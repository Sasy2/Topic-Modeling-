Week 1,"Which female wants to get some? The school dey kill me o i’d give up all my men for you but you said you’re not ready for anything serious hm😔 Some squad deg toss early in the moring I am a sex addict (I have never had sex before). Charle the school hard. But i still go graduate That engineering department hm I have the biggest crush on that maisy girl in 26, heard she has a boyfriend abroad but that won’t stop me from getting her  I want the Nicole girl in 26, but she’s been reshing me and plenty other guys  School is too overwhelming and overloaded. Sometimes I feel like ending it all fr sometimes i feel like jumping from the hostel rooftop. i stood there for an hour before turning around and going to my room.  So the education issue I know nobody forced me but why is it so hard oh what a life fam, its annoying that some gates are locked around 11pm. What is the point? Why is Big Ben so stingy with their stew like come onnn More food places on this campus would help also a laundry service off campus would help because tell me why I am carrying my laundry all the way to school. I am not Kofi Kingston yk  Why is the gym closed at 9pm what if I want to do aesthetic boy and go and lift at 2 am How would people who want to play a sport but are shy of playing a sport go about playing a sport yk . Cause me I am a shy person"
Week 2,"That one guy Julias, he too smart! I also have a crush on him but he's short 💀😭 Didn't someone do this last time and it got shut down? i have this guy i’ve been talking to for a while, well not for a while, it’s been six months and he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. idk why , it bothers me cause i feel like he’s hiding us . doesn’t post us i don’t think even his friends know that we’re together. what do i do?  Ashesi boys have 0 class and are so entitled and judgmental, it’s disgusting. All they do is kiss and tell and be proud of it. Sorry for generalizing, but it’s quite a number of them who do this. There’s no honor in kissing and telling and the people you’re telling to, have no respect for you as a person. They need to grow tf up, we’re not kids anymore.  Having swings was such a great idea  There isn't a space for hopeless romantics here  honestly speaking Ashesi boys enjoy kiss and tell and even add stuff that didn’t happen to the kiss and tell ei? so just can’t keep quiet? must you tell everybody? and you’re proud of it too, treating girls like trophies trying to bag all of them. that’s quiet nasty  Word of advice: do not date an Ashesi boy, protect your peace please🙏🙏. They will lie to you and make it look like you’re desperate.  26 girls are whoever they say they are. Their beauty is out of this world  that tall boy in C’25. thinking you can get away with the things you do lol Can they move Big Ben to Akonnor’s location and sack Akonnor Some Ashesi students are the most corrupt people I've ever met.The most shocking for me are those who parade as good people. SHAME! Chale why am I fighting for my life in a half credit course? #Leadership Be specific wai... bunch tall boys dey c'25. Make you no spoil wanna brand😹😹 Ashesi boys don’t be shy to approach we don’t bite…sometimes  Ashesi girls will show you pepper Beatrice c26 I really really appreciate your friendship 💖 i hope your hairline recedes till you grow bald, evil boy Somebody for humble munchies. Just because they’re the only ones with waffles them Dey take we play There is one guy in C'25 , every single day he is lying  One day that Leadership I lecturer will see me waiting by his car with a bat #i’lldoyoubeforeyoudome shout out to all the girls with locs, you guys can have my school fees 😫 My lady in C'26... You'll be mine soon (she follows this IG page) <3 The smoking will kill you o your lungs like eyi. Jesus loves you all❤️ New masere boys, leave your room na we like you oh! I go for basketball games JUST for the boys😀 Munchies forget o, Peckish Pen for the win🔝 That short boy in '25 be knacking people's girlfriends, he looks innocent but he's the devil I tell you! People be fucking too much on this hill. Even in the handicap toilet, backseat of the car! Eii! God is watching you all How explicit can we get we these confessions? Hosanna Hostel😔. Those who know, know. How can I call munchies and in the middle of the order they’ll tell me “Call back I’m taking someone’s order” Ah then why did you pick the phone? If God did exist,
Then you would be mine,
You're in my prayers,
Every single night Maybe it's cause I forget faces easily, 
But I can swear I see a new ""most beautiful girl I've ever seen"" every week The current ASC should stay out of this elections Taking the right path sometimes makes you seem like a fool Why is this boy such a man-child? At your big age? Oh nooo NK and his group, C'26, are so mean to girls in public places. They think it's cool. It's time to grow up, assholes! Please post more responses🫠 Those guys who don't like scholars,what have we done err🥺🥺? At least talk to us. This school is too boring ah This school plenty funfoolers dey. We all dey complain say the course dey lash we but the person you dey complain plus he get 85% Those boys driving cars that will give you 1000 excuses instead of just being straight up when you ask for a ride go and chew your cars wai🙄 You guys should tell us what is on and off limits because what I want to say dier🤣 Ashesi Health center is such a JOKE Somebody for humble that Derrick guy for Dzidel’s. How can you hang up on me. Tsw The engineering department dey kill me hm Ashesi girls need to smile some more. Lots of you are unapproachable. We understand the school is hard but no be we do am please  I heard there’s a Stallion in C’24🫣😍"
Week 3,"Can’t wait for C’27 to join in January ,I heard they’re sooo fine. A lot of students vote for people without realizing it is a commitment to support whoever they vote into power. If a nation fails, it is on the faults not only of the leaders, but also of the people that didn't position themselves to run with the vision they voted for. As a matter of fact, many vote for people rather than visions. No wonder the blame game has many subscribers  Please, at least 2 posts a day🫠 I am very happy that this semester will soon end.
Bye Bye to FDE !!! Imagine o, we'd get rid of FDE very soon.... Honestly speaking, how do girls want us to approach them? To the girl who has been speaking to the guy for 6 months now, have you asked him the reason why he hasn’t asked you out? If not I really feel like you should. I think Ashesi girls could also meet us halfway. If you like a guy please let him know . Charley munchies too their new pack why? Them dey serve kids for children’s day? You tear 5 spoons nor the food fini… Ashesi isn't as stressful as students make it seem. Most people are just handling other significantly demanding things besides school or are simply disorganized and/or bad at managing their time and commitments Girl, regardless of the duration of your conversations, if he's creating doubt in your mind, remember the sister code: it's time to step away. So what is the point of locking the gates behind the new lobby and hostel 2C. Any thief can just jump over the wall. Fam, its annoying that some gates are locked around 11pm. What is the point? The one saying Ashesi isn’t stressful dierr I want whatever they’re having cause ei😂… What do you mean let the guy know you like him? If the guy likes you enough, he will approach you. There’s a certain room on the top floor of New Masere. Those two boys should know that the hostel walls are very thin wai😂we hear all the nasty things they say about people🤢 But ashesi boys do you smile? How can I meet you halfway🤣 Ashesi boy math: They ask if you are single but never shoot their shot🙄 The man at essentials too why just small thing he dey get angry or he don't know we are Dbees. You guys for talk to him ooo New masere boys, please line up outside, stop hiding in the room, I want to see something 😀 I’m looking for some guy in Dufie Annex
If you’re nice,please meet me at Hakuna 
11 am Saturday sharp👍🏾 Nana Yaw Ntim. I want you. Just because we vote for leaders doesn't mean we are not allowed to criticize or blame them. We are holding them accountable for the promises and dreams they sold us when they were rattling their manifestos.
 The fact that we have given someone power doesn’t mean we should follow them blindly and keep mute when they are not fulfilling their duties. Dear Ashesi Boys,
Not all of you are destined to have beards and that’s okay Repeat after me Ashesi boys: Braids are not for everyone!! I don't know what to say but hi guyss
 Some of us are shy, but we are fun when you get to know us. Don't hesitate to approach us guysss😘. Person canvas dey show four 90's and one 67🥲....and guess the 67....0.5 Leadership!!!!😪...why????? Beyond surface level interactions, about 50% of Ashesi Students are assholes! Ashesi girls should stop saying we don’t approach them. If we do, you’ll tell us you have meeting to go to. The new Perkish place has better waffles. Bye bye burnt waffles and wings for 35 cedis. Do Ashesi boys realize some girls are simply uninterested like please focus on your studies and leave us alone I love my friends so much! Ashesi really breeds some long lasting and meaningful sisterhoods and I’m so grateful🩷 Eiii boys beware ooo… they said don’t approach them. They’ll bite you. The hate is too much for so called ethical leaders. It's in the air, everywhere. It's just a degree. Please breathe and free your heart. Rapture is near yk!  Yo, since the Ashesi boys won their game against Academic City, we, the Sisters, have agreed to dish out free smiles all week. I am thinking right - munchies is the worst on Sundays - i can’t order food until after 4 pm and their on campus “franchise” doesn’t deliver off campus. Please don’t tell me to talk - it’s exercise. I beg yew  The ashesi girls don’t they have ceilings, we are waiting for the surround sound videos"
Week 4,"please ‘ink is back’ or so; if you no fit post gist, shun because what’s this “boys meet us halfway” and “girls smile” boie3  Anytime you see Tracy C'24, the cute one, give her 50 cedis and see me, I'd replenish it for you. 

~Secret Admirer~ If it’s been half a year and you guys are still in the “talking phase”, idk what to tell you sister 😄 Low key why are some Engineering not helping like that. You see student putting in so much and you give them 1 over 20 in quiz. They scornfully marks I'm assignment and labs, at the end they get an E . . . Like howwww ?????
 Grow up boys ! Stop kissing and telling !! Y’all are making Ashesi seem like high school ! Bro you’re not 16! Talk to God instead of man! There is a 24 girl, you always ignore me on campus, you don't even say hi, so please stop sliding in my dm my dear. Thk you Ashesi girls with wrinkled thighs and black  bleached asses, please stop wearing those small jeans around. I feel sick when I see them. love how 26 boys go all out and spend on their girls To the girl who said ashesi guys should focus on their studies and not to approach them, please we need you only for our stay in Ashesi not for life so please cope and be humble. Thank You Will the bus thing to Accra be implemented before the sem ends? Masa, even people who take parking tolls in kejetia and things is it not 5 cedis and 10 cedis. 300 dollars how?! tsw Triumphant entry koraa Jesus didn’t take anything, they should take their road omo, una dey suffer - parking fee dey sound like una e-levy (just my humble opinion 🤣) - sika mpe dede nti UT cabs dier cash out season o cause you dbees still won’t want to walk✋🏾😀 I never really understood the meaning behind those who drive to campus from off campus aside showing off. You are at Dufie but you have a car because you can't climb a hill? I mean, I get it's easier but are you 50? Be fr. I dunno, a lot of your are overreacting to the parking fee. Who pays to maintain the roads, bricks, asphalt, line demarcation etc.? That's the point of the parking fee. You enjoy a resource, pay to maintain it. If the school fees go toward it, then you're forcing people without cars to also maintain a resource only you enjoy. Pay up or walk. The car park thing is or in my opinion a policy to curb the number of cars on campus because some members of staff who drive do not even get a space to park but i am wondering - are the staff part of this new policy? 
3,569.67 cedis a semester for parking?
fuel b3si sei? Next sem dier Leg-xus nkoaaa o Basic economics, people who value a commodity more will pay higher to use it (independent rationing mechanism). If you can't pay the parking fee, park your car off campus and walk. Those who really need the parking space will pay. If you can't pay, walk to class. Other universities that offer parking space also enforce parking fees and stickers because someone needs to pay to be maintaining the facilities involved in parking. Do some research. The parking fee is necessary mmom because some of you are very inconsiderate. How will you come and park your car at the same spot from 8 am till midnight depriving other people of parking space? If Ashesi now introduces parking meters too you'll complain, but you're deliberately hogging up public space. Those of you that have also been parking in the disabled parking spots, and long periods at that too, why? Don't you understand the point of disabled parking? At least, now the parking fee will force a lot of you to reconsider your selfish ways. The person talking about showing off should spend a sem at Charlotte and see something... not an ashesi student but it’s ridiculous to make students pay *in dollars* to park on campus. say the reason is even for make the campus greener, ashesi students probably bring cars because there isn’t readily, trustworthy transportation from the ashesi team. considering the school fees they pay too, it’s wild that they’re still finding ways to take money from students 💀 I know we all say this but from the bottom of my heart I’m tired  The next year 3 semesters dier them for bring the grading down o Really dreading next year This parking issue is a reflection of Ashesi’s pure wickedness. First having to pay fees for the accelerated semester, now $150+ a day to park? Very inconsiderate of our parent’s money."
Week 5,"If you can't get a proper and secure voting platform stick to Microsoft forms😒...@JEC ei but they typed oo🤣🤣 That 25 engineering student with the “ uk” accent. You are not who you think you are wai. You naa you know yourself and what you did. Tsw I think some Ashesi boys Dont actually know when they're crossing the line into sexual harrassement and should get educated in it. Like seriously. Understand that No means no. Pt 1: You a, you said you'd been studying me and you wanted to date. I said sure lets talk over a proper date. Sake of 1 munchies sharwama and 1 sandwich you had to buy, you waited for me to get back to my room and sent me a message that “ you don't think you're ready financially for this relationship “. I said vim, no problem. Pt 2: That was 1st year 1st Sem. 2nd year 2nd sem , you changed your number and came back to text me that “ you’re so sorry for “hurting” me and it haunts you every time you see me and you want to approach me blah blah blah.” I said it’s alright I’m not hurt or bothered, because tbh I don’t know you. You are the one that was “studying “ me . Pt 3: I said I’ve forgiven you no need to feel haunted. You said oh let's continue what we started I want to approach you . I said respectfully I’m not interested so no. You keep forcing, I keep saying no.  There norrr “ don’t you go to church, so you can’t forgive a brother?.” Ei! On top my own personal preference you’re harassing me and questioning my religious background? Please I know the children my mother gave birth to wai, you're not part. Ashesi boys please learn some manners SLE and ODIP  needs to talk to Ashesi boys about consent. You can't just touch a girl if she has not verbally expressed consent in participating in whatever action you want to do. If you can sign contract kraa sign. Before you get carried to AJC for rape or molestation. MUNCHIES PLEASE WORK ON YOUR KITCHEN END - FRONT  DESK END COMMUNICATION!!! How can I come and order food that's on your board you're telling me it's not available for 3 consecutive meals?? Even giving me tissue to clean the board for you. Ei. Yall started so well idk what is going on now. Some of you are either immune to this bipolar Berekuso weather or have never been given a ride and it shows🤭 The 'maintenence of resources' does not hold water because the roads are a public resource and even if no student brought a car, the school would still have to maintain the roads and all associated with it because it is in their best interest as staff and visitors will also use it.  Those who can pay will pay. Sure. However, don't you think it is unfair and somewhat unethical of Ashesi to price students out of parking when the crux of the issue appears to be the school's failure to factor students bringing cars oncampus into their campus design? The $300 parking fee is excessive and can only be a temporary measure until they provide students adequate parking spaces. Trust, more people than they expect will pay and that parking fee in the end will not solve the issue. Let's not pretend they do not have the resources to provide adequate parking. Besides, Ashesi needs more parking spaces if they plan on hosting big events with visitors. Oh but you’ve been staring at me since the start of the semester oo madam. Don’t be afraid to approach please, girls can approach boys too. every event you are looking for a bomber lmao Going around asking for votes is sad. Can you guys stop already.   It’s appalling how people start making generalisations after a bad encounter. Charley y’all should check your facts before you make generalisations waii😤😤 why wasn't Kb nominated in the first place ? Some Ubora Awards nominees were patched(illegally put there)  Why do Ashesi girls like to generalize Ashesi boys like that about things. If things were reversed it would be termed misogynistic or misogynistic adjacent. Most of them are mid and they see themselves too much I get that Ashesi is a school for extroverts and all but, people need to stop assuming every student is an extrovert, it's not easy for some of us. Our social battery dies really fast we beg relax for us😭. It takes time for us to come out of our comfort zone so please we beg bare with us and be take your time with us🤧🙏🏽 Engineering must be so easy because drafting an ASC mail, curating Havoc and mass brainwashing - All hands on Deck🤲🏿 Where free food dey, my vote you get💀 Aspirants doing a good job,don't know where from ASC tho😒 ASC and JEC got beef or what?🤨 Some coming with policies and others with promises  I think whoever it is who came up with the genius idea of sending an email to the student body that can influence people to think one candidate is a fraud should be relieved of their position - it was grossly out of line and unethical! So much for ethical leadership🙄 Someone should tell Salia to answer the question about the initial poster. If he doesn’t we won’t vote  The Whole campaign issues ( salia factor) is the fault of the vetting committee and JEC. This should have being addressed a long time ago Is Ashesi ethical ??. cause..."

 Peer review be some nasty work Peer Review is crazy 
Tell me why someone is only realizing in the class group that his teammates sold him out The engineering students dey see demma body too much ah. Nobody forced you to pick a difficult course  Nobody dey vex me pass the dean’s list people who dey complain  Somebody free me from this evil school  Someone should tell Gilbert C’26 to stop talking to other people’s girls and find his own The Hi5 people too dem dey keep plus the food. Someday I waited for almost an hour"
Week 7,"Quaynor ‘24, I have given up on pursuing my computer science degree. I am now pursuing you 🙈 just so you know… I hate it when Ashesi boys threaten to remove our wigs. It’s pathetic and unfunny  I just wanna give a shoutout to Stack and Rolls. Chale the samosa dey bee ooo, and chale that kosua ne meko just hits right. Just go to Old Hosanna on Friday or Saturday and tell me I'm lying.  Hey guys, so about the new parking policy, some of us are signing a petition to push the board to reconsider the implementation of it and take the concerns of students into account. Kindly sign this as soon as possible if interested using the link provided. Na 300 dollars dier bossu ha far? (For the Ink Team. Please make this link active on the post so people can click on it. Thank you). https://forms.gle/6FyEkZRie7fBxHoV6 is Kofi Agyapong (C'24) single? So when people see the opposite sex talking, it means they're dating? Like fr? What happened to healthy relationships? So one can't keep female/male friends without thinking of romance 🤔 Good luck to everyone on their exams this week. I know this sem has been rough but let's finish hard. We've got this🤍 What's really fun on campus though? Personally these parties and ASC activities don't even hit. Well that's kinda failed so let's go natural, try some stand-up com or sth next sem🤷‍♂️ Hi 5’s service is far slower the munchies. They fell off really early🤣 We need to take a moment to appreciate Mrs. Awuah because Pre-calc wasn't easy, but this woman made sure we had it easy.  They will say yes, grades ain't important, but just pass by Nutor Hall. You'll see their names on the dean's list. Shout out to the fanfoolers out there... I love love my girls who help each other pass the courses in Ashesi. Much love to Zuu, Purity, Yaa, Sally, Bernice, Bel, Anamalia ( C'26). So, I am a Snapchat newb. And I had a crush on someone I had never talked with.
But I used to go to his Snapchat DM and write a lot of things I would never send. Sometimes, I did this multiple times a day.
And I did not know that Snapchat sends you a notification when someone is typing in your DM.😂
I wonder how many times my name came up in his notifications
If you are the person, I promise I am not weird, I was just delulu🤣🤣🤣
 Munchies food is bad fr!😔 Fde too you carry T.I 89. 😂😂 Why the TAM another approach dey way we go take calculate am 2hrs and 30 mins FDE paper too you carry belaqua 1500ml 😂😂 why ... tell us so who handles this account???😭😭 How do y’all get over crushes as quickly as possible? I need to get over this boy as fast as possible. He’s threatening the peaceful balance of my school ecosystem 😭 Appreciation post dedicated to Sylvia in C2026. Beautiful, smart and kind hearted girl who is also God fearing , a great friend you are. Much love.❤️ This thing of coming to use with no strings attached mindset must end. Some of us are here thinking about marriage and you want to come and play? Dey play. You never share my responses. I give up🚶🏾‍♀️(in the other direction) Austine, your help to Pre-calc students will not be forgotten. Thank you so much for being a nice guy and taking your time out for us. See you in Statistics😂 This is a huge shoutout to people in the class of 2026 who have taken up initiatives and played wonderful roles in the community; Stephanie, Beyoncé, Daryll, Akua, Nana Amoako, Maame Yaa, Peggy, Reindorf, Joshua, Pfungwa, Ariana, Mmalebna, just to name a few. You truly are inspirational and trust me, you guys really make a difference. Keep doing you!

Ella for JEC, Dasuki for Vice

Argue if you don't think so.

 Some boy dema call syme take my babe. God see's all. 
Next semester I'll do cornrows like the boy so she'll run back.
 NGL I think because of the beautiful women at Ashesi, I'm joining the LGBATHQ community. Because we no didn't sign the honour code, they think we are criminals lol. Some mentality fr. #Justicefor2026. Don't know about y'all but this walk isn't shameful, it's a walk of pride because that nigga make me weak. Austine (Pre-calc), I'm grateful for time and effort you put into helping me and other students to improve our grades. Keep being the smart, nice guy you are. So those of us who cant pass the papers this sem the grad we no go see top?🥲 Networks students, please we have a class at 6 p.m after DSD today, because what Bob Sowah wants to do to us deɛ, hmmmmmm😭😭 School is stressful? Let me tell you 3 bytes about it; hopefully you'll get :)

One step at a time 
Paying the currency of time 
More sour than lime
Disconcerting like brine 

There is an end that is mine
Through the path that I stand
There's no gain without a price
But sometimes I wonder if I can

I bear the pressure daily 
Like 10,000 feet beneath the sea
It appears I'm drowning 
Yet I still manage to see 
I still manage speak right from under the deep

It seems I've been there for many years 
But strangely experienced not death but only fear
Wondering if it were more than me yet finding no tears to grieve,
I looked around and noticed a sea of others living beneath this heavy sea strangely easily

Then I realized, I never really was under the sea
But in  simulation of the things that must be
No wonder I could breathe and still manage to speak
Though the water was thick and sometimes darker than ink

It sure seems tough for  a simulation but I guess it's worth it if I can breathe and live under any depth at the end of it Am I the only one failing FDE?? Because eii Engineering mechanics kwerh!!! I can’t do this for four years o The semester was very stressful and challenging. I can't believe I'm already studying into the night for exams eeiii level 100 wow Hmm if I start, I’ll vex waii so it’s okay. I’m just glad it’s over. Eihh. Odeishiii Everyone is playing with my gradessss!!!!
FDEEE eiii hm. I now understand, 'nipa no bi y3 cobra'. Nipa no bi y3 cobra ankasa.  Trust no one🤧 Chale I beg Eiii semester of struggles. In fact this semester has shown me shege
 Since the grades aren't grading anymore, I might as well start prepping to be oga wife😂😂 I don't know who needs to hear this, but whatever your grades may be, do not let it define your whole life. Your happiness is worth more than grades!🤗 A word to our all-knowing colleagues: Life is full of surprises. So learn to support others without making yourself feel too good."
Week 9,"It’s funny how FIs that are past students act like they haven’t been students before! Dear Wednesday,

Like a fiery furnace, this feeling burns endlessly,
My soul searches for yours earnestly,
From the first glance to our first trance,
Finally confessing you loved to dance.

Lost and found myself in you,
A journey you walked in shades of blue,
Lost and found a story so divine,
Forever we hope our hearts entwine.

I sought a change, you brought in me,
Like deliverance, a soul set free,
In the loud silence of my night,
Whispers of your love takes flight.

Hoping that in your hands, my heart is safe,
A hiding place, where my love finds it perfect shape,
Forever, a time to short to be with you,
For in the heat of moments, our love is born anew.

Low key Ashesi Girls could teach some boys how to be around women oh. Like, there are a lot beautiful women / ladies yet most guys will remain single till they graduate. It'll be sad if a guy leaves school and still is ""shy"" or not good with women, oh, like how 😔 ei, nti saannnn I haven't been on the Dean's List ever since I began schooling here. I know I never thought about it's essence but ei, herh 😔 Ei! Ariana break heart o. She leave Ashesi, she no tell anybody bye and I make plans for next semester. Asem oooooo

 I was playing Cocteau twins(heaven or Las Vegas)in the dlab and someone hummed along. Didn’t know who it was but whoever it is, mmuah💋💋"
Week 10,"Hope I'm not 🏃🏃 too late. 

Want to say a big shout out to this girl who crowned academic year 2023 for me by putting a 🌺 in my 💆 I think she really deserves the best of all worlds especially in 2024🫶 and I wouldn't be ndn 2023 right if I don't get this shout, out. 

To whom it may concine, big long hugs😝, love☃️🌺"
Week 11,
Week 12,You guys should relax with all the valentines day preparations and things ebei we're still in January 😒
Week 13,"We’ll share but you’ll not share😔 Valentine's Day is fast approaching...
Mr Crush, don't be shy; come talk to me; I promise I don't bite. 😂😂 So last year's valentine's the ASC made something like what the ink is doing where people would anonymously fill a form and then wish their crushes, lovers, secret admirers a happy Valentine's some even confessed their feelings and these were later posted on ASC snapchat...it was a nice experience. How about you guys do something like that too but this time around make sure the forms go to the class group coz some people couldn't fill because they couldn't access the forms....please consider this..... i beg i can’t take it anymore. How do i tell my roommate she’s sooo noisy. She and her boyfriend can be on a call for 48 hours. 🧓🏿SOS - it’s enough pain to be on campus.😭 This semester dierrrr only God oo"
Week 14,"It was such a good idea. Good execution as well. Ashesi people once again didn’t show up Ashesi people hm. You say you’re bored on campus but you won’t come for an event Please tell DJ Fadda to improve  Boiler room > imullar A sober party is a crusade duh Someone make me your valentine😔 It was damn boring.I mean why play songs that 3% of the people know 🚮🚮🚮tell the first Dj he is BORING.He should play songs that interests everybody and not himself👎👎 Any He available for the Valentine week?... Me want date  Please know what you want and stop wasting people's time. In case you see a Barça fan on campus please take your time and talk to them. A hug won't be bad as well. They're going through a lot. Please how can we enhance Red Army?  Ever since you left, life has been great. But it was greater before you left. Comeback. More boys are pretending to be single. And more girls are pretending to be in a relationship. Arh well, guess who is struggling. There is a group of 3 called The Legends(2025). Your connection since first year is well acknowledged by everyone. Kindly teach other guys to do same. You can't see one and not see the rest in few steps away. Hey B, you've been missed. Text now..... Valid event, despite the l,ow turnout. I’d say it was a blast. Entercomm did a great job.  We don't come because we don't get to grind "
Week 15,"This Moss code checker is crazy Those saying Ashesi students didn't show up. Some students had three submissions due that night. How did you expect them to be there. Come on.  Those sending sublime messages for people to comeback to their lives, how are they supposed to know it’s them? There might be 50 other people in the same situation. No confusions here I beg. I am still hoping my crush will come talk to me... 
This crushing thing is not easy oh 🥲 Our love was like cold fire
Now it’s like drowning fish
She’s happy in another’s arms
And it burns my being hearing and seeing her happy with this other.

 I miss her, I really do. She’d see this and not know it’s me, but I miss her a lot.  The guy who said he misses her, just text her or she cut you off ? 1st February, and I'm seeing people surprising a girl with a gift. Let's wait for the 14th wai. The oppression is too much 😂😂 if we were a serious community Aunty Caro wouldn’t be getting any customers fr The events suck because people know that they will be/feel judged by others if they are outwardly ratchet. People want to GRIND, dress however they want, and be less sober without  being judged for it, otherwise its just a crusade. Womp womp! Ashesi has SOO many rules that it has bred a culture of pretenders. Ashesi students can party but once we come to this hill we have to PRETEND to be good little boys and girls. Good boys and girls are boring at parties.  The parties suck because ASHESI is a conservative highschool with pretenders. For all those saying the parties are boring or whatever,you can leave the school. You read the handbook so you knew what you were getting yourselves into. You can always leave the school to party. No one is stopping you Class of 2024 boys, please stop admiring 26' girls. We're rich, sexy and out of your league. Stay with your girlfriends we beg. Mwuah! The hill isn't safe. You speak up and the staff are waiting to kick you out. You laugh with people, but deep down they can't stand you. Read, work hard and leave.  So we are not going to talk about the queer people in Ashesi? Hmmmm. I'm just coming and I see them wai.  Tell me why I almost gave that short boy a chance?👀. I love tall men but the way he was so smooth with his words, I almost told him I didn’t have a boyfriend😅and he’s freaking smart too cause the way the banter was bantering guys…i’m a loyal girl though😊 How do I tell this foreign guy that I have a crush on him? Everytime we meet he always has airpods on😭 Should I just approach him or wait for the right time? Valentine is coming though….HELPPP😭  Found out today that his birthday is on Valentines…new ick unlocked. Men are not supposed to be born on valentines, thats selfish This new ASC is really good. Keep up the good work. People will start to turn up The school forgets the fact that once you deny people some things the people develop some sort of silent rebellion and all you’ll be doing is raising a bunch of hypocrites who outwardly portray fake love for the culture buh deep down…. I want to believe that those who were complaining about the school rules actually realise that it is a school. This is not some club to allow you to grind and do what you want. Besides you appended your own signature to the acceptance form so if you can't abide please a withdrawal letter is very simple to draft( RESPECTFULLY)  Don't be deceived by atmosphere, when you see men carry your things and runnnn💀😂 
It was dusk on my perfect day
In my world that knew only one queen
The clouds had killed my sun’s bright light
I couldn’t watch her leave, so my tears blurred my vision Highlanders is the SI unit for trash 🚮  Most people go off campus to be wayward. Stop lying about not having privacy. Just say you want sex. Stop breaking that girls back in New mas. The girl who said 2024 boys should focus on their gfs and not 2026 girls, I promise you, is not all of that. No male species has ever moved to her before, just an attention-seeker🤣🤣 ‘24 CS girls- you’re who you think you are okay? Beauty+brains+career-oriented… top tier women!  You said we should have sex I said no, I don't see you like that, now when you see me you behave like you don't know me. Foolish girl🙄 Never will I want to be in a room with Niger people ei❗️ The plan was to be focused but there is this 27' lady shifa I don’t even know if I’m getting a Val’s day gift from this guy and we’ve been “dating” for a year eii  ASC should share flowers for the singles so we don’t feel left out on the 14th😭🙏🏾 very random but can Academic City stop trying to be Ashesi so bad?!! Like we always ignore but this has conversation has to be had causee ughhh"
Week 16,"I always say I like tall men but my eyes have been on this short king 👑 on campus 😭 I think I am into guys who have a girlfriend 🙊 Personally I am jealous of the security men on campus. They have better sleep than I do 😭😭😭 1. The people who spoke about us being pretenders have such a good point.The more you look at stuff,the more you start seeing the hypocrisy of not only the students but the school itself

2.is it by force to be a leader??especially a service leader.cause I didn't sign up for all this....I'm only here for the money

3.so you mean if I don't know the right people, I won't be selected for committees,opportunities and stuff?It's not all opportunities that are like this,but some are just too bad.

4. Honor code is flawed,especially how classes have to sign on.How many of you can deny this?Exactly.... Been a long shaky road, and I don't mind going down the road anytime anyday with you. You're literally the love of my life and I'd do anything to make you happy. I love you from the bottom of my heart and I want you to be my valentine ♥ 2024 boys won’t stoop down to try anything with any 2026 girl. Most of y’all are clapped; there’s even an 88% chance that the person that sent the message is clapped.
We’re rather on the 2027.💆🏾‍♂️ Come correct for us to give you the attention you dearly crave. The girls have started replying fast oh🤣 Some can even send me assignment answers when I haven’t even texted them😭😭 how do I tell them I already have a gf?🤣 Why do the FIs behave like we’re in class 5? Ah What's happening to the Hive
So many restrictions  originality is so cute, esp. on a campus with the major populace undergoing an identity crisis   The latest review needs to go through quality control. As it is just a hate piece and not worthy of being read.  I am trying to forget about you. But how can I? It hurts me so much.
How can I forget about what we could have been?
You are all I see, but you don't see me.
You are all I see. Please see me.

Thank you and great job guys. To the “lifestyle influencer” in C’25 and her minions- it’s ok to talk about people, we all do. But have some self respect and be discreet about it. Church girls and “mental health advocates” don’t behave like that. Shame on you One short guy dey run things for every year group, I no fit see wetin you ladies dey see for am. Abi e don ask any of una make she be hin valentine? We go know next week...😂😂 Julius ‘25,the best boy bestie anyone could ask for,funny,stubborn😂, realest homie i’ve met on this hill, smart af, lowkey. Thank you for finding me a boyfriend too🫂~T Who said I should take 6 courses? Look at me crying any moment I remember what I’m doing to myself.  Why are the librarians always shouting?  Bernice(26 twin), why’re you pretending as if you don’t know that I like you? Please loosen down cuz you’d be my Valentine. I liked you and you didn't like me. now I like him and you like me.... we're fucked  Love as hard as you can for we are all made of stardust and we'll soon turn into stories no one will remember~ Valencia  They all look the same around here and I can't recognise who they truly are because they hide behind an aesthetic façade. Same hair, same style, same everything. What happened to difference? AJC case cooking  rn. Watch me send hosannas very own away.  The purple room was a huge let down again this semester. As a woman, I am saying this, Fear women because ei🤧 why then if he's so perfect do I still wish that it was you Will you die if you ask me to be your Valentine? Boys too why😭"

Mwxuah I just love this girl ! Every weekend I talk to my mom about her  These couples hmm The sun turns green with envy upon sighting you
he seeks for refuge behinf the clouds whenever you step out
because your radiance outshine his
You've got stars for eyes
Twinkling with humour, mischief and love
Your heart is made of gold
and your skin is of silk
smooth, creamy and without blemish
You are a true treasure
and I'll sail across the seven seas to have you.

Or they are still living in a dreamland? Because ei!  Why do we have classes during midsem week? @academicCommittee do something about it Masa make nobody come ask me how the paper go….. how e go for you sef???

Week 20,"Guys, I think I'm in love🤭🤭 this boy is acting like Pharoah and won’t let me go 😆 Weirdly i miss school. Like all the work and pressure I miss the guy with glasses and a red mac in my oop class  Got my heart broken. Just trying to heal now. don’t come into a females life, break her and leave. If you're broken FIX YOURSELF and stop messing up other females lives. There are so many good females out there that are getting hurt on a daily basis just because some selfish guy out there can't be mature enough to know that he isn't ready for a relationship.  <<<anyway my break is going great so far It’s going to be a long week without you, KKC my love 😖 I love Jesus I'd understand the ISA getting low funding but nothing at all? Are international students even part of this school?
The treatment during the December break and now this? Why do international student even pay ASC dues? The ISA doesn't involve the whole school? That's the f**king point!  The ISA isn't getting funded cause domestic students aren't involved? the paid services off and on campus should realize that, it is not about the money used in purchasing(food), it is about the service you give; how you treat us! Because why have I ordered ORDINARY indomie at 3pm, keep calling and finally you pick at 6pm and telling me you forgot? You actually say “o I forgot” L O L wai! Why is the current government being attacked like they just didn’t come into power? Omoo…please you’ve been doing well…keep it up waii 🙏🏽 My biggest shout-out goes to Miss Vanessa at ODIP. Such a sweet lady. God bless her for me!🤗 Dr Korsah, Dr Ayawoa, Dr Maame
All inspiring women! Big shoutout to C’26 girls Can we take a moment to appreciate Lahari😮‍💨. Such a hard working lady and very inspiring. A HUGE shout out to Pfungwa. She's funny, brilliant, and always her self. Love her so much 🫶🏾 Big ups to Kirsty c25!! Dr Aurelia and Ms Natalie. They made writing enjoyable to learn and do A big shout out to Maxine Victoria Brenya  C'24 you're so caring and amazing sis, muah😘 A big shout out to all the students at Ashesi. Those struggling with anxiety, depression, low self esteem and identity crisis especially. All love on this end, we got this❤ 🫂 A big shout out to the ASC .Thank you for your tolerance and patience😭🙏🏽. Especially when it comes to organising school events that require the attendance and full participation of Ashesi students💀 Can someone find those twins for me in c25 who always dress up to class? 😭❤️ like how many suitcases did they bring 🫠 in my very honest opinion, the PR for the current ASC never ceases to amaze me 👏🏽👏🏽…I’m actually too excited for ASC Week ngl 🤭 I heard Arthur c25 is single…can someone confirm this, I’m asking for a friend? 👀😗 Shoutout to C’24 CS girls. Hardworking fr the back to back entertainment from entertainment committee this year is commendable and I know this year would probably go into the books for the best asc week in Ashesi. Big shootouts to them for their hardwork🙌🏾 I miss Shaun Mensah from calculus class. Your face makes me smile even when I don’t understand what Jomens is saying                                 Hard truth!!!
They always say we’re equal here, but deep down the rich make some of the scholars look like beggars🤝. FDE and Leadership classes shows it all!!!!!!!"
Week 21,"😭😭😭😭the shito Akornor served today buying shock absorbers for my GPA! Heard while walking through the Archer Cornfield, ""as soon as a hoe realises that I, a man, cannot provide...""
Wow I sometimes leave in the middle of class to go eat. 
In my defense, you can't learn on an empty stomach  Can the school have a rage room please?? I have so many unresolved emotions building up😭 I'm reallyy anticipating this year's ASC week idk😆 Why won't this boy just ask me to be his girlfriend sup😔 ASC week finna be a hard long week for us introverts. Where do I hide? Library? The country's internet connection may be down, but you know what isn't....my connection to you babe.Text me😘 Ngl some people rlly get me wondering what high schools they came from. How can you comfortably shift my laundry off the line? With your actual bare hands? Ah! Imagine looking forward to Island riddims all week only to realise how mid it is😂😂😂🤡 This ASC is unoriginal! Poor PR! Chat gpt generated names for the days of asc week! Do better 🤣😭  Oh Salia do better!  NB: this current ASC were not the people to get the bus initiative running! Kudos to the past ASC. At least they were original.  Salia= Nana Addo. No difference🤷🏾‍♀️ Entertainment in Ashesi should completely be canceled because it doesn't make any sense how the asc ALWAYS puts in so much effort and Ashesi students always make it a point to never show up ASC please next ASC week invite DWP academy 
Some dancing needs to go on At this moment, I'm just tired  If it's not too late to invite Dwp too why not🫠 The noiseeeee ei
Some of us have quizzes go study for o"
Week 22,"It’s was fun and definitely a blast 🥳.Someone tell the Ashesi Dj I want him ~An’26 It was great even though it was on Sunday  but next time bring some alcohol men. Atleast put some limits andeasure as long as it's night party alcohol is necessity to have full vibes  Island riddims with no riddims? 👀
4/10 To ASC: would you please organize a masquerade ball? As usual, bananas of the school where not represented in music yesterday... anyways they are just bananas... who cares Even if ASC brought Drake, no one will come  Car convoy to launch crazy day🙏🙏
 Crazy day👀 There was a lack of engaging activities and not much that represented the theme of ""Island riddims"" or "" caught in 4k""  I want to fly, but my wings are clipped
I want to run, but my shoes are ripped
I want to walk, but my pace is slow
I want to crawl, but the thorns have grown

I want to be happy, but I don’t know how to
I want to be free, but as free as I am, I’m caged
I want to dance, but the music taste is sour
I want to laugh, but only jokes I tell are funny

I need my peace, but I lost it in another
I need my mind, but the voices are not from my mother
I need my life, but it goes away in the empty days
I need my world, but it’s dried like hay

I need happiness, but I seek it and don’t find
I just want to be happy, I just want to be happy This ASC WEEK<<<.  Tbh island riddims although the Jamaican music wasn’t there the vibes were there once you get past the “people are watching me mindset” and start thinking “ I came to have fun” Boring not feeling it frfr  First day was fun  The Ashesi Dj (fadda) did his thing .I hope he see this I have a crush on him 😍 Shout out to Nigeriaaaaa I am marrying from Burundi or Rwanda  I love love 🥰 the new gov't but people chale come out 😪 Crazy day is the day I can truly be myself  Shout outs to Annabelle '27.... consistently dripping this weeek Asc week is meh. Engineering students have midsem(s) this week No KKT at a car event 😳😳 the theme for the ASC week should have been “if you no dey vibe, you know dey inside” because if you did not join the fun, how you go fit enjoy this week! - 10 outta 10 minus naffin  This one de3 ebi “now” or “never” o Play variety of music not only amapiano...it's more of a west african thing the rest of us don't really have as much fun....dancehall is quite popular🌝 Ooooh noooo here we go again. Ashesi concert gonna be fire with only 2 people attending but still fire 🔥 🔥🔥 Dj fadda needs to notice me 🫣.Mepe wo wai 😍(An’26) An entire council sat to plan this, things happened but we enjoyed. So the critiquing you do is thumbs down unless you can pulling the planning and execution of an event. KERS! I went to sleep after the cables caught fire …. I love sleep … but that was the Biggest mistake of my life … Herh 🤧🥲 I don't think the whole 'No Crazy Zone' concept should exist tbh. It's just one day in the ENTIRE year that Ashesi students get to let loose like that without consequences. It's a relevant part of campus culture and I think it's something that lecturers can plan their course outline around if don't want their lessons disrupted. Just let the students have it, chale. What's one day going to do? I am not in the ASC,but anybody that will come here to trash the effort they put into making this event becuase of the challenges yesterday, is a fool.  Great work done to the ASC! And to our cute ASC president🤭, we see your efforts and I just want to say be proud of yourself!! The music was mid, amapiano every time, overplayed Ghanaian songs and the occasional afrobeats. Y’all need to up your party music game for real! Dancehall, Riddims, RnB, Pop, Rap, Hihop, Reggaeton etc. are they a joke to you??? 
My bathroom concerts are wayyy better than what you guys spend money on🌝
Pay me I give you my Playlist 😂😅 Freaky Friday was honestly the best day. I was scared that the event would flop when the cables caught fire but the ASC pulled through🔥"
Week 23,"The ASC needs to apologise to all the artistes and performers that were disadvantaged on Friday. Even if it's ""supposedly"" not their fault, it's the very least that they could do. To: The ink
Instead of spending time criticizing events you have little to no involvement in planning, use your power to shed more light on systems in this school that don't work, like the health center or eateries. Just to let you people know I’m soon to be taken! In case you were crushing on me, tic tac! A lot of cases at AJC, stay safe kids. Did you all agree to make everyday NO_BRA_DAY?? because from 7pm daily I see many dots Please ladies on this hill, because a guy is friendly/nice to you does not mean he wants have sex with you. C'mon be matured!"
Week 24,"It is not everyone that has to be a fashion icon🤣🤣🤣. Please shift. chale introverts we're really suffering in this school o😹 we've reached THAT point in the semester....nothing is funny again please can we restart the semester, I made a mistake somewhere😭 on friday let’s all just go and sit at the archer cornfield and protest how they are treating us  I legit can't take this anymore. I told myself I wouldn't cry this sem. I've cried like 3 times this week alone, and we just got back from the easter holidays too.... I HATE LEADERSHIP SEMINAR WITH A PASSION !! Can we petition about the rage room pleaseee??! Omo the academic weapon has become an academic victim. this GPA dier hm God hold me abeg, I'm going to faint, what's all this 😭 Umm one quiz made me move from a B to a D? Unless I nail this exam because it’s looking like my only comeback  School is really affecting my head chale. Scholarship student but the evidence isn’t showing I’m a scholar.💔 Exam pressure aside, I don't remember the last time AFA posted something about the Ashesi Women Football league. Is AFA for men only now? What at all is going on on this hill kraa 😂😂 You people are stressing out Dean Abdul o 😭 But knife parhn 😭. Someone said Ashesi Zorro😭🤣 These AJC cases are actually getting out of hand 🤣"
Week 25,"Is Big Ben interested in running a cafeteria business on campus or this is all a little side quest/ side hustle for them?????? SMH 🤦🏾‍♀️.  I'm really fighting for my life over here, God abeg. Do I have assignment deadlines approaching in a few days? yes
Have I started doing the work? no
Will I finish and submit before the deadline? yes 😭
 My blood pressure keeps rising every minute. Exam season in this school is literally the worst😂 So because of a half credit course I can't have peace of mind, ei Herh, Munchies has become really stingy with the food  Why them shun dey share free food???"
Week 26,"All my problems started when i started Pre-calculus 😔😔 Finally the semester is over, I'm wayyy behind on sleep😭 Next sem academic weapon fr fr This school was after my life but ohhh, I serve a living God!. Thank you Jesus for a successful semester😩 This sem the wicked men were too many. The word I’ve used the most was “Ei” because EI Let me break it to you, all of you in relationships or talking stages with ashesi boys, they  are cheating on you. Take it from me  Next semester is reshuffling time! So let’s get ready to exchange our s/o🤣 The way you are wicked, aren’t you afraid that someone will curse you Ashesi must be the only place where cheating is more serious than sexual assault. This is insane honestly  A rapist with several victims and his punishment is suspension for 4 semesters but someone cheats in one exam and they get expelled? Ashesi University do better. You can't get up and preach ethics and then punish rapists less than they deserve. Disgusting. Oh, right, because apparently, using someone else's meal plan is the ultimate crime worthy of expulsion, while, you know, sexual assault and social misconduct only get you a slap on the wrist with a few semesters of suspension.  The ink should speak up on what is right. Someone got a sexual misconduct case and was guilty but no explusion?
FUCK ASHESI. SAY NO TO SEXUAL MISCONDUCT  Fuck KKT, FUCK ASHESI, FUCK THE BOARD.  The ink needs to come out and say something about this case. You're supposed to represent our actual thoughts. Someone was guilty of sexual misconduct. I beg you guys to get justice  Please also show this to a sexual misconduct staff that Mr. F in 2025 is a creep and an abuser.
I'll drop all the names of girl if I have to. Just get justice. It’s during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month too that a sexual misconduct case gets that kind of a decision. Vim wai.  A place that talks about the honor code but someone who sexually assaults another only gets suspended🙄🙄 #makeitmakesense can you people like shut up?
it’s an academic institution not a social institution 
of course cheating is going to get a serious punishment ffs
it can really happen to anyone tsw I made it through another semester Hurray 🥳🥳🥳🥳.It was not  easy ,l almost gave up but God gave me strength🙏🙏. 
At the end of this semester l realized time management and a time table or schedule is very very important. 
#lesson learnt 😌😌

Week 27,"I’m with this girl but I want her  roomate  Are you even suppose to be told to clean before you do? Are you blind ? Freda Marie ‘25 is the SWEETEST GIRL EVER😭🫶🏽. I love you girlllll🥹❤️ bruh the roommate thing is actually so frustrating. y'all tell us to tolerate the Nigeriens but they're so inconsiderate and LOUD. stuff was never getting stolen from the fridge in my hostel before they came but if I say it I'd be the one who has an issue with them.  Are lecturers in for our good? Cuz rn, they’re becoming a hindrance to even getting a B+. Just look at the microeconomics email I received this morning. Tswww I will not allow this school to make me mad!! Statistics is a someway course o ei 😂 I am very grateful to Joana (2025). Even with your own busy schedule, you sacrificed and made time for me. 
Thank you, I couldn’t have done Pre-calc without you.  This course registration on CAMU is pissing me off. Been locked down at home for 3 days of my vacation. But I WILL NOT HAVE 8AM They need to set aside like 2 days after every semester, where lecturers and students can fight school can honestly finish itself ✋🏽 cause I’m done 🚶🏽 So the accelerated semester CAST!?

Feel it - d4vd, 
Best Part of Life - Saint Jhn,  A whole friend group of grown ass women fighting a small child because of a man who doesn’t like either of us?😭😭🤣 oh ✨️women✨️ Like love’s last call,
I’d wish to dance with her at a ball,
At the glamour of her looks,
Our hearts would form bonds through hooks,

Watching her slip into another’s arms,
Finding him hospitable like yams in barns,
Except with every other girl I’m empty,
And with her, my heart is left dirty

With puzzle pieces left of my soul,
Part of which she stole,
In this livid world I crawl
Seeking peace from the last brawl.

Finally I found my rest like a token
But, she knocked back and I opened
Like fireflies she lit my heart up,
Now it’s burnt again  I’M DONE WITH THIS SCHOOL! I’M DONE WITH THIS SCHOOL! I’M DONE WITH THIS SCHOOL! Ashesi please why are you doing this to me? If he doesn't like me like that, he should honestly just leave me alone.  The school pretends to care about us and claim to address our issues but come to town hall meetings to tell us why they can’t do anything about the issue. Tswww HERRRRHHHHH AWINGOT!!!!!😭😭😭😭 Ngl. It still hurts that they brought Kidi. Agyeman '27 can't wait to see you this sem😭 Let's all pretend the accelerated semester wasn't a bad decision by the school admin I think the level of depression in this semester should make everyone fast and pray"
Week 29,"Father God, as we start this semester, help me to be present for, punctual to and awake throughout every class. Help me to be diligent in my studies. Above all, help me to use my time wisely. In Jesus' name. Amen. Ei Big Ben…these abele cups de33😭 Can we talk about the recent lecturer changes? It's kinda frustrating when we sign up for a class with a specific lecturer only to end up with someone completely different. Please o, if the government has reverted the 2028’s coming back in January , why are we still doing accelerated semester please?  I miss you Fadda 🤎,An’2* for the love of humanity, MOISTURIZE YOUR FEET! it's too early in the semester to be this ashy. Amaliah you are sooo gorgeous herh! This school will not kill me this sem 😭 Finally it’s Friday, thank you Jesus😭🥹 Well, the brain is not braining…The school ahhhhh🥹👀 Masa I’m tired. This sem dierrr my gpa should be able to afford two bottles of water from munchies  😭😭so we aren’t halfway through the semester??? Ei so the Bush Canteen was it a one-semester stand or what😭 Please for some of us it was our lifeline oh, we beg😭😭😭 Ah Big Ben what kind of abele cup is that? ""How do we tell the ocean that we are drowning on land"""
Week 30,"I can endure many things, but never the humbling experience of falling on campus. I pray against that everyday. Day 1 without the gym. I miss the cool metal feel of a Barbell and the post gym aches :( All the academic readings are boring and long. Someone go tell the lecturers. Xoxo Being in the same class sith an ex crush... falling in love through muscle memory  The girl with black braids and a stunning smile won't save you. Go and read for AI Eiii mechanics😭 If you were planning on falling in love this semester, don’t do it, i repeat abort mission‼️ Big big adults pushing against a glass without using the actual handle will never sit right with me ...lots of intelligent students do not make it to the Dean's list, quite sad. I am overwhelmed. Too much social interaction - the struggles of an introvert"
Week 31,"Just taking time to thank all the people who put effort in being nice to others. I have not had the best week but some people were really so niceee to me. Sending lovee 🤧🤧❤️❤️ Can we get a summary of what was said at the town hall? Ashesi is just another high school. Which one too is town hall meeting 🤣🤣. It was good that we could share our concerns hopefully we see them being addressed as soon as possible  Just found out that there’s a book launch happening on campus soon. So excited! Shout out to the writer Kwaku Osafo! 🥳 27s get a cake for what was once considered the bare minimum? honestly, i’d like to congratulate the 26s for shaking the way the school views themselves Why are we still in school rn? Cos I thought it was cos the 2028 will come in September but now they’re coming in January? Town hall might as well have been a zoom meeting or an email.no reason otherwise Interview Nathaniel Ameveji C'2027 please... 3rd eye security 😭 Interview me Pfungwa 2026

Why would you watch TV at night on full volume when people are trying to sleep, some of you people are very inconsiderate. Someone get these cats ID cards or get them out of here please Fun was havedddd, it’s a pity only a few students attended , but nevertheless we had fun, we want more of these.  If I hear 'Cast' by Shallipopi at any event again, I think I'm gonna end it . How many times are we gonna play this song?! 😭 “Anonymous” forms on the hill are not! Some people are so mean! I don’t get how a person can wake up early in the morning and choose to be mean the whole day! This is why we all need Jesus😩! It was funny seeing some individuals ignored and made others feel invisible in school and I thought it was just because we were kids😂! But years after, they’re still the same people! If you do this, with your right arm on your chest followed by a deep breath, repeat after me: “SHAME ON ME!” Now, get off your high horse and be NICE, you’re not that age anymore!"
Week 33,"40 cedis for breakfast ?? Eii
Damn I am really poor  June is men’s mental health month but no one is talk about it. The double standards 😑 The rigging for the photography event was crazy. Like it actually shocked me. Those judges must be audited Proud of myself for leaving his childish ass I recently read a Bridgerton book about the duke overcoming his stutter by staying calm and thinking before speaking. As an impulsive person, I tried his strategy for my quizzes and did really well this week. I'm looking forward to more success. Cheers to aces! 🥂 Not texting my ex even thought I wanted to The judge of the photography event that asked Maisy to wear a shorter skirt if she was referencing femininity needs to explain himself further.  Proud of myself for keeping my sanity despite the crazy week I had  1NRI releasing fire fits this, we love to see it  I've given up on trying to find love on this hill😭 p.s this is my second semester What are y'all feeding that cat? It's getting thick Sometimes you just gotta put on some billie and have a good cry in your room😭 Honestly, I still go through our old chats and notes to remember how happy we were, or at least how I thought we were then push forth with the day!"
Week 34,"How can we care about our mental health when we endure mental stress from this school to the extreme? We just pray, exercise and meuve wai. Affirmations really help me. 
Also spending time with people I love and telling them how much I love them. 
And just making time for me to do me things Futsal with the boys >>> I watch my comfort show (girlfriends... its really good) when I'm stressed I lowkey really miss Ashesi succes I really don't know how people survive in this school without the Holy Ghost ei! It has been God throughout😊 The scripture that says ""By my God I leap over a wall"". Indeed, by my God I leap over these assignments and quizzes cors ei🫠 It’s a shame how Ashesi is all for “inclusivity” with all the women empowerment and opportunity emails, yet I didn’t see a single email on Men’s mental health month, June  “a little birdie been tweeting about Empower Her’s second bridgerton👀” Why will you decide to come and sit directly under the AC in a class that has countless empty seats and then you increase the temperature of the AC because YOU are feeling cold?? MY FRIEND??? She calls me daddy
Happy fathers day to me  Niggas who wear hoodies to a classroom but still turn up the AC. You deserve to burn in hell. "
Week 35,"So everytime something has to go wrong at the gym?? Tired of those emails fr This accelerated semester thing has really done a number on me. I’m not even playing.I used to be so happy 😭 Nooo why can’t I stop thinking about this boy, I can’t even focus on my studies 😭 This man makes me sooo happy. The happiest I’ve been in a while🥹 Hm it is well o, God will see us through in this Ashesi The English version:
Aaaarrrrhhh
Libido's trapped me again.
Tight top, big boobs
Horniness is calling me to her
And I feel like obeying
But that's silly and impossible
Silly because 
Libido's a drunk fool 
That breaks the neck 
Of rational prudence,
And impossible because
Even if I want
I can't get:
Shyness dries up my fuel of courage
No girl probably wants 
Me to enter their tunnel
And that's great
Cos libido and sex are drunken fools!
But
But
Le plaisir erotique* 
Sa motivation puissante* 
L'éspèrance de la grande joie* 
Nothing as engaging as it
This tug of war
Bewteen prudence and overflowing pleasure
Will only end when
I grow into Pope Francis' weathered body
Unfortunately.
Oi I see another girl with
Tits as big as a cow's own
The tug of war resumes
Oh here I go again

The French version:
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Le libido, il m'a piègé encore.
Chemise petite, des grandes seins
Le dèsir erotique m'appelle à elle
Et je suis incliné de l'obèir
Mais c'est bête et impossible
Bête parce que
Le libido, c'est un bête ivre
Ce qui casse le cou 
De la prudence rationelle,
Et impossible car
Même si je veux
Je peux pas obtenir :
La timidité séche mon essence du courage
Aucun fille me veut probablement
D'entrer son tunnel
Et c'est super
Car le libido et la sexe sont bêtes ivres !
Mais
Mais
Erotic pleasure*
Its powerful motivation*
Hope of great joy*
Rien aussi engagante que ça
Ce tir à la corde
Entre la prudence et la plaisir surécoulant
Terminera seulement quand
Je grandirai au corps patiné de Pape Francis
Malheureusement.
Hein je vis une autre fille avec des
Seins aussi grandes que ceux d'une vache
Le tir à la corde continue
Ah allons-y encore

* - the marked line must be italicised
 your friends could actually ditch you because they have found the love of their life, sucks These emails about the gym, at this rate they will start informing us about who just entered and left the gym. I just want to go home please.  In fact I just want to finish this school Ah so the people in relationships do they know that they are cheating on them 🤣🤚🏾 Ashesi boys will kill me lmao 🤣  What is the highest elevation on campus? We were once very close friends, he came around and now everything is messed up with her. SUCH IS LIFE My boy is even too busy to hang out,me sef I’m too busy 😔✋🏾 I have midsem tomorrow buhhh the amount of breaks I’m having is way more than my total revision period! Can I just get the degree now, (like in honor of my perseverance😭) Midsem sha! The only thing that has managed to take my mind off that guy! By the time I finish writing my papers, the crush will have vanished😭 Hmm ,bare minimum kraa enfa ooo So why would go to study areas like the library and databank 218 to make noise when it is meant for quiet studies??!!!!!!!! zero pressure, but the fact that I have zero pressure means my calculations are wrong since SLE is talking about CONSENT, let me just say it is not the case that if i’m wearing grey sweats, then proudly look (or touch)🙂 Shutouts to Akosua and Aseye!!! Idk how else 'we' could have survived Leadership II and Principles of Economics without you.  stressful week but i saw my crush today and suddenly life is worth living again  Chale I begggg😔 What happened to Ashesi D:Lab, please? I miss Hackathons 😥😥 honestly we need the opposite of caught being good for some people. some caught being bad...cause it's not even funny You guys should actually watch some of the 27s play Futsal, pure entertainment and talent What are these noises always from rooms in New Mas? Some of these caretakers in the off campus hostels should actually watch themselves  This FI Michael for Calculus is so proper  Isn't that smell in Akornor annoying? Big Ben Jollof actually goes too hard It’s interesting how Ashesi boys think it is so chill and nice to tell girls to smile I just need one very long hug.  That Big Ben Jollof person is lying😭 This academic weapon is going blunt😔 What kind of bipolar weather is this? Room inspections? Are we in Senior High School? Why am I just hearing Bend it Bend it from the first floor of New Hosanna? Running in the rain while holding an umbrella is crazy. Have you no steeze? Ashesi 2025 boys why? Like why?? Have you not done enough??🤧 Something was bothering me. Then I took a nap and now I can't remember. 
Naps>>> These dogs that roam on the road to the hostel late at night, they are so SCARY I’m glad we did not work out. Goodluck to them you’ll look for me in every girl and you won’t find me 27 boys are attractive 😍  Chale Dufie ants are too many ,th⁉️⁉️ Why are the women at Big Ben so moody?  I know we all wanna be academic weapons this semester but please and please again, don't attach your self-worth to your grades. Trust me, you really don't want to learn this the hard way 🥲. A 'D' doesn't mean your life has ended. Strive for good grades but don't let it define how you think about yourself. The division in this school is so clear, but they make it look like we’re all equal. ( I hope you post this😭😭). I can’t count the number of times I’ve been made so uncomfortable.  The way some people have been treating me, I can’t wait to go home and block them all😂! It’s okay, I’ll take your crap for now because this is not my country anyway! Every day, I can’t believe you guys are the adults in this country, let alone this school!!  I dislike the way Big ben is nonchalant.  Seems like the owners might be millionaires  Contrary to popular belief, people don’t mind their business. Is it your life? Mind your business, please😒 Please stop taking videos of people taking free food. We won't come again ah😭 Everyone is in a relationship eiii😂 Most of you guys are engaged in pseudo productivity. What is it that you’re reading up to 3 am, then you sleep the entire day in class🚮 Exams are stupid, there are better ways of testing students knowledge  I’m scared It seems like our Ashesi boys just wanna tap that, nothing much nothing less, must be nice. Hope is all I had, it was snatched and destroyed. I’ve got nothing now but the tears that blur my vision of her. Big Ben’s new shito… is better than Akornor’s 🏃‍➡️🏃‍➡️🏃‍➡️ No because, why are you - a fresher - leaving your heart in the hands of a C’25 boy. Do we need to tell you??? I don’t know why people think when you approach them you want to date them lol, as for the division it’s everywhere, not just this school  Heavy on the ‘being made uncomfortable’.
Because we all know in our hearts that it won’t last. Tell me why you’re playing with my mental health in my own room🙄
You two should just get a room. So you didn’t know he was following you to your room🙄
He magically appeared and bit your neck? Berekuso Dracula. Serial entrepreneur. Jumping Jack. I’ll end it here  Nothing is ever that serious. Except for the liberal arts courses. Don’t joke with them 🚶‍➡️ Is the accelerated year even legal cause they working us like slaves  Those asking for hugs and things should relax,  you're probably the most hostile and unapproachable people and you want love You this girl in old mas,I miss you let’s get back together chale the streets are not for us "
Week 36,"This capstone wants to cap me in stone but I serve a living God.🙏🏾 I have a crush on this girl, like I really like her .... I don't think I am good enough... ei  Her name is Sally btw I have the most supportive friends. Shoutout to Tani!!!! Shout out to the Intro to AI folks fr
We made it this far
We'd finish the course 
Hang on It's funny how some of you want to be treated like adults but act like kids...smh😒 Big shout outs to the support center
Those boys are the real ones The '27 girls are very much underrated. Argue with your screens ..the division is indeed everywhere, but why will you use the wealth of your parents to make people feel bad when we are having healthy conversations? No one is being bitter here but that’s the truth and the disrespect, let’s not even talk about it( I see how most of them make the international students feel unwelcome and they laugh at them). Please post this.. We need a C’25 boys recovery support group The hierarchy of wickedness in the school is from 25 then 26 then 24 boys . The 27 boys will become wicked when the 28 girls arrive You’ have done yourselves married couple in new mas when ecast, it go bloody Stop using your bare hands to shift people's laundry on the line. Have you no dignity? Put that high school culture behind you ffs. You still look down on people? 2024? Oh bossu To those people that borrow chargers and power banks and don’t return it, God is watching you. Grades really matter please 😭😭😭You still have time to do better 
An advice from me😌 Stop laughing in groups as girls when some boys you don't 'see' pass by, it's disgusting  Shoutout to Aisha from Akornor, she's proper for real So today is when you have realised the wickedness of 25 boys ,y'all will learn the hard way , wai 💀😤😢 It serves any 27 girl right if she's done dirty by a senior Some of you smell too bad, what's the meaning of this? It's a particular demographic I won't mention  Obiaa shirt brand ad3n? Amapiano is dead and I love it Sports really keeps some of us sane in this school  Must you always dress for attention? Shout-out to McNobert C'26
He really helped a lot of us with our Intro to AI assignment 
If not for him, the Zero would be waiting for some of us 😂😂

We love you bro 🫶🏾 Never trust a Ghanaian woman who swims. Eii mechanics!!!! Do they seriously think the code for passport events won't be shared?💀 Grading on a curve is utter nonsense   Can you be more specific, some of the C’25 boys are innocent 2025 boys slander??? I’ll be there!!! Demons fr Let’s not forget C’26 girls. Very evil  Those circle of boys in 25………🚩🚩🚩🚩run  girls run!  These ridesharing company drivers cannot stop complaining about the berekuso road 🙄 Dufie ants are plenty oo why?⁉️ Need a 26 girl like Maisy to save my life 😔 Please C’25 boys haven’t done anything you people should rest  C’26 girls. Hmmmm very wicked  The C’25 boys only the on campus ones are wicked. The rest are good Some of you people 25 boys haven’t done you anything you just want to feel among That light skin boy with glasses in 25 on campus who likes reporting boys to their gfs. Why are you jobless ? Wahala for 25 boys o🤣 25 boys we need you to come and remove your mouth immediately 😭 Idk how i’ll survive the rest of my stay in this school when my crush graduates this year (He doesn’t know I exist😔) Ah so is everyone fornicating on this mountain? The 25’ slander is too much😭😭(except for the dj and his squad, they deserve that shit) Zero rizz. I just follow you on Instagram and leave the rest to God hmm Please why are the girls crushing on ‘25 guys?? The ‘25 girls don’t even do that. Ewww Nana 26 is so fineee😍😍😍 The C'26 girls are heavenly stunning especially A**** Some of you talking bad about 25s on your stories do not know any 25 boys, I'm certain of this. Shout out to Hannah🤣🤣
love her fr🫶 Can't wait for FDE to be over!
Literally get upset every Tuesdays and Thursdays 😔 Idk why you people are on 25 boys (because let’s face it, it’s only a select group of them that are wicked) when the real demons are in 24. Very wicked bunch. Every single one of them🫵🏾 The ‘25 boys are actually way better ngl. It’s the ‘24 boys .Very wicked and inconsiderate. Thank God they are leaving  . bye hillside boys , you will not be missed  Belinda 26, is so cute and friendly when you get to know her. I love her IG though ❤️😘. Wait till I tell your main girl what you be doing that boy in C’25 Why are people concerned about things that do not matter? I think everyone needs to grow up for real. Most ladies on campus, even guys aren't mentally mature for relationships. Moreover, I think it's damaging when all we think of relationship is romance (for guys) and class (for ladies). Any relationship should be intentional and defined, else it's for playing fr. Anyways, we all know what we're doing!!  lol that one friend group in 25. Only proceed with them if you hate yourself  nothing to say about the other classes, let’s focus on the problem. But you guys should’ve done a banner to warn the girls earlier about c25. Rn dier it’s late they are already dating them. Shout out to all the unfortunate souls dating these boys Cook them! Cook them! They deserve it. Especially those people The person defending 25 boys , you yourself you’re a problem and your mistakes will choke you in a sea of regret sia There’s this 26 girl who left me for a 25 guy very early in my first year too. Life has never been the same Hierarchy of wickedness and the 24 boys are last?? Who do you think taught the 25’s and 26’s what they know The person saying the dj and his squad why don’t you say it to our faces? Please the dj doesn’t have any squad o Why are you people now using anonymous to voice out. Are you scared of 25 boys? “Even 25 girls don’t do that” but the whole school you them no dey rate Funny how everyone is saying “25 boys” but we all know the exact boys in that year😂 makes sense how one of them is the entercom chairperson “DJ and his squad” man you people should shut up  If one of you can step forward and boldly say a 25 boy has done you something do it. follow backs like yourself By the way is the Dj single…?trying to shoot my shot(even though they are saying he and his squad are scary) “Wait till I tell your main girl” 😭😭fruity guy aren’t you shy. Let me catch you My Boss Richard🙌🙌🙌 Dating in this school is hard cos everyone is literally in your business ughhh  4th grade you would be soooo disappointed that you're currently doing pre-marital things unpopular take: i reread old messages to make sure i don’t miss anything  The same way you enjoyed the relationship quietly with the 25 boys no, whatever that has happened, go through quietly na mongyae nkwaseadede no 😒. The way The Ink admin is unnecessarily selective of the kind of things posted here should be studied. Their filtration system is weird. You post slanders but you abandon opinions and real pleas. Or are you triggered by some of the facts? If you like, don't post this too. Truth remains truth boo <3 I don't know what the school can do to actually bring everyone together and for us to be a solid community. No matter what the school tries, it just doesn't work. Very segmented. the person who spoke about the ink's selectiveness is soooo damn righttt😭😭
cos tell me why I'll post my mind on the same subject twice, and you'll overlook it?? I be having the worst of days, but then I look up and remember that at least I didn't bite someone's neck and get suspended for 4 semesters ASC, pyjama day? And oh for the division, most int'l students don't really care because there's life beyond their small retard**d brain who think we don't have ambitions. Lol, the most ambitious students are int'l - they can't compete or relate  Stop using daddy's wealth to look down on people. Get a jobbb Why do schools make it such that students are forced to walk through the rain and get sick for boring classes??? Ink Admin reveal?🌝🫣 I read something about your interview with Maame Mensa-Bonsu and learned something thoughtful. But what's the essence of canceling the Dean's list when there will be no clear difference to show how others excel and how others are encouraged to excel merely by seeing other people's names on the Dean's list. ###BringbacktheDean’sList Such a haste decision to cancel the Dean's list. I love how my friend and I can talk about the Bible for hours and it never gets old (hint for them: ES Playlist❤️)  Too tough to be sentimental but Belinda and Bernice c’25, love you guys so so much Merhn.  Bring back Dean's list. Can we all stop pretending thay it is not normal for there to be segregation??? Ah
Let's be nice and cordial with each other but there would always be some divide so stop making it sound abnormal. Just do your part and be nice to everyone and accept that we cannot all act like one big family please. Shortest boy in the school Sedem, he is funny af. Good vibes in general 🫶🏽 Most Ashesi girls are not that pretty as they think are tbh, but they are very arrogant. Most carry the riches of their parents in their heads and think it determines their beauty. Lol  If the school fees you pay, your personal GPA, and your desire to further your education in grad school does not push you to excel them forget about Dean's list broda Bragging rights were never the main goal but being on the dean's list provided a great deal  validation to those who put the work in to excel. You can't judge a person for wanting to be recognized for succeding. Unless some other form of public recognition or reward will be put in place, bring the dean's list back. My best friend is the most supportive and the most down to earth person ever. I’m so happy she’s in my life, I love and miss her so muchh🥹❤️ I love the Ashesi students who still make efforts to talk to and befriend the introverts in the community. We’re not mean, we’re just reserved, please bear with us😭🙏🏾 Ohh so you people won't shoot your shots at your rushed by name again??? I’m grateful for the non Ghanaians in the community who are very expressive, I get to learn from your culture so that’s cool🤭 I love and am grateful for all my uni friends, especially the ones I made in my first year, wouldn’t have survived without them. Their the best❤️ I love that she loves chicken wings - 14643 So, without this dean's list, how would we know the smart one when we need help? I love how she suck my balls Lady Marge…just love her. High social and emotional intelligence ❤️ In every society there is segregation. Let’s accept that and live with each other in peace. We know we are a big family ( Ashesi family of course) but when it comes to individual relationships we are the same people who look at each other and define our own boundaries. When you approach anyone there is no way they are going to decide whether to socialize with you or not based on their “social status”. Just avoid defining your boundaries and expand your network on campus. It’s that simple. Cheers  I just love how my girlfriend knows exactly what to say to me in every situation. And she soooooo fine obviously. Top 3 girls on the planet fr. Imaginary or not, she has my heart ❤️  I love that he cares about me deeply. He is bad at communicating but puts alot of effort into talking to me. He smells great! Has a beautiful and generous heart. He's non-conventional too and I like that about him. Ashesi may have many annoying humans but there is a few like him, who remind you to be thankful.  Masa, if you’re on the dean’s list you know you’re on it. No one wants to know. Keep it to yourself! Happy birthday Anamalia, ilusm. (Please post this for me today, it'd mean so much to me) For the person saying the school is segmented, the big question you should be asking is who caused it? For a fact, Ashesi students complain a lot but I think the administration is part of the problem. Everybody is a hypocrite and living a lie!!!!! 

You can literally feel it Cancelling the Dean's list is necessary imo. You can get your motivation elsewhere. Moreover, you never know who your true friends are. Imagine being the only one there amongst your friends yet you do stuff together. The world is getting riskier baby Reality check is realizing that no one cares about your GPA if you're going for industry stuff. A sad situation is realizing a few of the 4.0 geez get good jobs but a higher percentage of 3.5s below get better/great jobs will clear your doubt. Do well, and let your motivation come intrinsically.  For the person waiting for motivation from Dean's list, sorry. Your motivation should not be from others. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself doing unnecessary comparison. And as they say, comparison is the stealer of joy Shoutout myself for playing both sides to always win This capstone... only God ooo. Abi if I get some C/D+ ago still graduate or??  They’re not taking your grade away, if you need deans list for motivation I suggest you re-evaluate your purpose here lol Are they completely cancelling the deans list or are they just not posting it on the wall anymore? I think some recognition is definitely due but no posting on the wall please I would recommend a personal email be sent out to whoever makes the deans list. It keeps the recognition without making it a public show off. Whether you decide to tell other people or not that’s up to you. can we do a lost and found for wangaari laundry? they sometimes mix up people’s clothes. really essential pieces too To the person who has an unconventional guy, please what's the year group. Seems like we'll share. Gems are rare to find Ah. Ewurade. For legal and ethical reasons i will unfortunately never be able to fully express how grateful I am for ChatGPT. I am slowly losing my ability to reason and analyze, but im truly grateful  Nothing scares me more than the fact that the girls know that the ajc will be on thier side if it is against a boy and they know they have this secret weapon even if it is not warranted, like using it to punish you for something else under the guise of harassment  New update: ask her to record an audio of her giving consent to have sex with her with the date and time and everything. If she says no, my nigga run, run like your mom's life depends on it. Amapiano dead???Wait for an event 🙂 The cat is not fat - it’s pregnant! Happy Birthday to the amazing Pfungwa! Can't this boy just ask me out? So you people won't mention your crushes by name? Are you people now shy???
 I've heard a lot of complaints about Ashesi guys, blah blah blah. But as a guy myself, I don't understand. Cause I think there's a lot of great guys here who are single. Maybe it's just the type you normally go for, idk 🤷🏾‍♂️ Hi 👋
Unconventional guy's unconventional friend here…
Hit me up"
Week 37,"I know enough has been said about this accelerated semester thing but goodness, I wish it did not happen. So much to do...so little time...mental health in the drain...all for what?  please if you have my sweatpants from wangaari laundry, send it back😔 For real, people are stealing clothes from the Wangari drying line. First was my favorite Tee, now it's my favorite trousers. Wth I was going to go for class oh, but when I was about to leave my hostel, the strong winds from the rain blew me back to my bed hm😞 The weather is sweet oh, but wrong timing, may3 hot. Three assignments due by the end of this week😂 If you see any CS on campus student hug them, we are going  through a lot right now😔 You will not get a reply from your target. Very bold of you by the way (page 21-24) How do people do the deed in Ashesi. Who has time and the energy to romance the partner, plan the logistics (especially if you have roommates ) and then actually do it. It’s easier and more fun to just send each other memes tbh 😭 Ashesi boys erhhh especially 25 boys  When it was raining, the number of people I saw walking so their steeze doesn’t drop😂 Great guys in this Ashesi abeg yewwww Some of us want to believe that there are some good single Ashesi boys here but how will we truly know if you don't approach us? The cat is pregnant, that dog is also pregnant 👀 I fumbled her .Damn I need her back asap ☹️ They need to get rid of that only today pin feature on mealplan, it's so irritating. The person saying mention your crush by name, my crush has a girlfriend 😔 you want me to mention name and cause drama ? Ei🥲 That Aseye F.I is wayy too beautiful That Kasanoma—Elite match was entertaining. I hope more people show up for next week’s finals. Kasanoma girls are wayyy too good, damn!!! Would y'all be Christians if there was no hell or heaven?  She’s a ten but she don’t care about Christ😫! She a 10 but she wears 1NRI so she’s  ♾️ She’s a 10 but she’s Christian and I’m Muslim  He's a 10 but he walks under people's umbrellas when it's pouring He tells his friends whatever happens between him and his sneaky link Hello He is a 10  but he is bipolar 😒🚮🚮 He is not circumcised 😭 He's a 10 but he acts like he doesn't know me when he's with his boys He’s a ten but he says he’s Batman  He’s a 10 but he is graduating soon😣 He’s a 10 but he smokes weed She’s a 10 but she’s not academically good She’s a 10 but she cares about her looks more then her books ( a certain 26 girl who always has lipgloss on and wears short things) She’s a 10 but she laughs like donkey from Shrek😔"
Week 38,"he’s a 10 but the only reason he talks to me is to invite me to church😭 Why is that snail beside the library there. Like what’s the purpose, the significance, meaning. We’re not questioning it enough. Ashesi is too small, boring and difficult to be a dry campus. I need alcohol and narcotics  Most of these boys who walk in groups and stand around ominously and staring , are  insecure and they need to be in these groups to look intimidating. Go to class little princesses🫢 So when will the socializing thing actually happen Airpods are the biggest hindrance to socializing. munchies coated their wings with shito and called it spicy wings. Ah?? When you tell someone with ZERO steeze that they have no steeze and they get upset... That jobless 2024 boy whose name starts with J and ends with “Ames” , get a life  Obviously Kasanoma is winning on both sides. Watch out for Pfungwa, Bernice and Prince, Naseer…..period!!!!! Kasanoma is wining obviously, not even Red Army can come closer💚💚 Nasser hands down. 🐐 Kasanoma to the whole wiase. Both men and women’s team are bringing home the trophy no doubt💚🔥 I bet she could never make you cry, cause the scars on your heart are still mine Apparently if the school burns down or someone dies we get free degrees 👀 I really hope the staff know about this page and do read the concerns here Are we in a Muslim school because what is all this? Smh
 Kasanoma females will defo win their match 🧌 The poster this year for the finals is amazing🔥 Kasanoma will win.  Nasser to score We appreciate Northside's efforts but Kasanoma is definitely going to take the cup. Better luck next time guys :) My roommate heard them praying in Dufie and ran to another hostel. Please brethren join me to pray for his soul 🙏🏽 The boys is a really really good show, 10/10 will recommend  Juliann is just HER, like the best female player in Ashesi, no competition! 
Argue w your phones  Let's go Northside! Why do people hate Northside so much? Expectations: Kasanoma to make history 
Reality: History make Kasanoma 
so now let’s call it Kassy🤣 But Fr Prince is the best player in Ashesi, hands down🫡 The red army female defenders are just amazing, Konama alll the way and the new player. It is sad that people are not giving them enough recognition.  Julian is not even the best red army player, let alone the best forward. The math is not adding up.  This academic year 
Expectations: get over with it and go home
Reality: vacation is basically a longer midsem break imagine setting low expectations so it’ll be easy to achieve but it still doesn’t work out"
Week 39,"A roommate can make your life a living hell. Why should you make everything about you? What happened to boundaries? No but whoever said that about Juliann! She’s friendly, sporty, footballer, EmpowerHer, jococo. One of Ashesi’s biggest stars in c25. You can’t hate this girl  Twins taking over football! Julia and Juliann & Bernice and Belinda 🔥 Just give the mvp to both pfungwa and juliann  both well deserved  If roommates are any window into marriage, I want to die single  If only Northside players weren’t such loud mouths, maybe just maybe, they’d be tolerable  Funny how no one is talking about the fact that Career Services lied to us about the ""passport"" thing just to get us to attend career fair suicide is never an option
if you’re going through something please reach out to someone to talk to🩷
ashesi is very hard we know that but think of your parents and what you’ll put people through 
love and light 🫶🏾 Hardest semester ever….. I need strength to be able to complete this semester, I’m not even joking  This school can’t take my sanity away from me o😭 Maybe the academic weapon is the friends we made along the way Please Dufie Annex people make too much noise in the evening! What is exciting so much 🙄 Sometimes we get to discover that the life we want demands more sacrifice than we actually thought  We find it difficult to talk to the ones we truly love. Not because of distance but we were never meant to be. Sad 😢 Ghanaian Security man: Mafren, if you’re parking, park well!
 If you weren't able to create time for God the whole week, how about 2 hours at church on Sunday? "
Week 40,"THIS 8AM LIFESTYLE HAS TO STOP!! FREE ENGINEERING STUDENTS  This couple I always see in dufie annex really make my blood boil instead of you to focus in school Need a girl with glasses and a fat butt in my life  So my man is leavinggg???? Damn  Worst semester ever 😭 The way AirPods keep getting missing in this school is alarming  The way AirPods keep getting missing on this hill is crazy  Dufie Annex is the home of all the bad boys  Icl I don’t give a fuck about UTSUN and most people I know don’t. School hard  This life is too short to be holding that unnecessary grugde. Talk to that person today👍🏾 The pain of purposely failing a course because you don't want D+ is unmatched This year's Ustun will be fire 🔥🔥. Kasanoma people are taking everything That.one.winner. Chale USTUN is about talent and hard work not popularity. you know you don't deserve it but you're asking me to vote for you🙄 Why does Stanley and Nigel have to be both good😭😭 Awards should be based on merit. The sports committee should not fool this time.  Kingsford?? Someone undeserving is going to be awarded just because  …. but congrats though 🙂 USTUN awards be making peeps who don't know you exist and never speak to you irl or since last year spamming your DMs... lmao. Not even real chat, broadcast message😂 Chale crushing on someone’s boyfriend is not easy o😪 from tummy butterflies to jealous to angry and the cycle repeats This boy is ressurecting the dead butterflies in my stomach ei💀😭 Selfish people pushing for their selfish interest at the USTUN, shameeeee. but why does someone’s relationship bother you? unless you’re desperately single. don’t be lame x  i’m sooooooo in loveeee with my boyfriendddd, God bless the haters 🫶🏾 Brigidi is a beautiful boy ughhh love is really a choice.  Senu don’t be lowkey! you’re too and nice for that.  but some girls in this school! like Odumma, so hot 😍 the number of nice girls bout to leave when 2024s graduate is crazy  The people behind Julian work hard pass. The comparison to pfungwa is so funny.  Guys help me. Am I being toxic if i tell someone I'm not voting for them because I havent seen them prove themselves worthy for whatever award they want to get? Cause honestly these 'vote for me' campaigns are getting annoying asl. Whoever did the kasanoma marketing needs to get their money, now everyone is trying replicate but it’s too good🔥🔥🔥.  What is pickleball? You guys are just dashing out the awards at this point. Stop asking people to vote for you,  if you were good we would know. Also, it's shameful to Campaign when you know the people in your category are clearly better than you are and deserve to win, and it took grace, luck or relationships for you to even have been nominated in the first place. I like my guy obsessed but not too obsessed.That makes sense right?? I LOVE TALL GUYS😭😭🫶🏾🫶🏾(my man🤭) yess, that couple I always see in dufie annex! pleaseee let us breathe we beg 😭 Dating here is for the release of stress and maybe some level of emotional connection. But if I hear you say love, I know you are very foolish.  i don’t understand men, you fumbled her, she’s gonna move on one way or the other, stop trying to paint her black just because she’s not getting over it the traditional way 🙄 Can someone take me back to first year? But with my brain knowing what it knows now? and not just about academics, maturity. There are so many opportunities I let go, so many mistakes I want to correct. Ashesi actually has resources, I just never took advantage of them, and now I fear it’s too late.  Asc where are you? Schools boring as hell! Where’s all your ‘we’d do better than the previous government’?  Charles Amankwah has Duke denis and Wisdom Kaye aura fr❗️❗️ If you are going to turn off all the AC in a classroom, you might as well open the windows. How the concept of ventilation seems foreign to people is truly astounding. Like you'll enter a class and the place smells like foot odour and manual labour. 70k cedis? Wow let me go and pluck it from the money tree in my backyard Leadership III teaching us about Collectiveness in the African society, come to the rooms of some ladies and you’ll realize something different. I forgot to turn off an iron I used and came back to see it still on burning the cloth and smelling while my roommates’ bed was right next to it🥹😭 . Bring back Big Ben #BBBB Anytime I see that girl with the locs with her man, my heart breaks a lil  I really love my friends so much, got me through the worst  The sports committee should stop rigging the Ustun awards. They should nominate people who actually deserve it and stop the nepotism.  Ashesi school fees exceeds the value of the education. Oh and bring back Big Ben #bbbb The only thing on my mind now is getting on that 10 hour flight back home to see my man😭. I really miss him🥹❤️ May the men stick to one lady please, don't go for the same friendship abeg 😭

Aarrgh chale!!!! Can the student life get better please....I mean we are a liberal arts school, so it should not only show in academics but everywhere else including social life and at events I would make it socially Liberal...The tension in this school is just crazy...Like why???To me AJC is the root cause of the boring social life here Why can't we apply for aid once admitted? The anxiety attacks hit different when you randomly realize that a slight family emergency or cedi depreciation could mean you have to drop out. If only Ashesi allowed students to apply for aid possibly on a yearly basis, life would be much more bearable for some of us knowing that we have a safety net.  People's response to events/concerts, they are very boring The fees💀 If I could change one thing about Ashesi it would probably be the location cause moving from Berekuso to Accra is soo expensive😭 Push all the workload to the first half of the semester, then the second half should be prep for final exam.🎯"
Week 41,"Everyone’s obsession with maintaining their ’aura’ why is everyone so obsessed with maintaining their aura? I would change the Ashesi girls Lectures should be given deadlines to return graded work The school fees ☠️ The fact that it’s isolated from the world Open canvas 👀.. where there is no judging, just helping each other out. The energy with which we came with during orientation, it should have continued 😭. The random greetings have stopped ☠️ no one cares anymore  The people in charge of school fees. 
How can the dollar rate the school is using shot up from 12 to 15.7, even higher than the current dollar rate. 

My fees went up from 52k to 70k. 
Why❓❓❓ Banning 8ams This school is so wicked!!! No empathy at all. You know very well we are so exhausted yet you’re still doing things to continually exhaust us and frustrate us. And at first you’ll think the lecturers are the ones causing this frustration. But you realize it’s not even them. They are also being stressed out. We need the school heads to be more empathetic! They should drop their “we care about you act” and actually listen to students’ cries. There’s a limit to which you can load someone, they should know it! And let’s not even forget about the 70k Cedis price tag on all of this. As I said NO EMPATHY. 170k tuition this year alone when you know families were not prepared for this your “re-alignment year”. That does not even include housing, feeding etc. At the very least, be more empathetic to families that have multiple children enrolled here. Because some of us enrolled into this school when it was 24k tuition a semester.  Ashesi doesn’t take sports seriously. If they did campus free time should really be campus free time  Computer Science Syllabus  They should stop fattening us and calling it wellness, food doesn’t always make life brighter again!! They need to research more about what student wellness truly entails because they continually do a terrible job at finding a balance between achieving “academic and social excellence” and ensuring students overall wellbeing, they always sacrifice the latter! A rule that says guys should put on their pants properly. Like dude, why are you airing out your ass🤌 When are we going to realize that being real is okay?  What’s the essence of unpacking what I wish Ashesi could change when I know it won’t because people actually enjoy making others feel like crap? Ashesi bruised me! The people bruised me! The environment bruised me! Even if anything changes, what do I do with the pain I’ve been carrying for all these years? I’m not your friend because I want your man. It’s not you, it’s your man that I want. Her red hair burns like the rays of the sun, I see her and I am lit. For she is beautiful beyond compare, the girl with brown eyes and fire for hair. I thought Ashesi PR wasn’t supposed to advertise student business anymore? 👀 i thought that was Enterpreneurship Committee’s job now?  this girl wants to sell everything under the sun smh  sooo what’s the use of the Enterpreneurship committee? cus why am i seeing PR advertising buldak today? 🤣🤣 last week it was bagels 😭 hasn’t the grass in the courtyard recovered? why are we doing USTUN in the hive of all places? 😭😭😭 All these Ashesi boys that drive fast in the night, what if you hit Aunty Caro’s boy. Please calm down.  I now understand why they put instructions in the washroom. I appreciate the effort but they have to try something else because it seems people don't read. FLUSH THE F*CKING TOILET. Why was Raymond not nominated? What in table tennis didn't he win? The politics is too much. You this Evans guy, what have you played?🤣🤣 Casuals sef dey lash you Can munchies stop giving us spoilt food? You pay and get to your room to fill your belly but nahhh To everyone about to give up, don't. You need pain to to excel. It's difficult but you'll be happy. Tell yourself you're the light in the tunnel. You don't wait for the light at the end because you're the LIGHT Quomodocunquize Will definitely win something in relation to volleyball and/or football, she knows herself. Goal of the season 

Welile Chilly Dlamini 🤷‍♂️ There’s only one women’s football MVP 🐐.  It’s finally Prince Osei’s season. This semester needs to end already! We're all going nuts here—three projects due in the same week, my boyfriend dumped me, and I don't even have time to cry about it. Everything is moving at warp speed, and I can't keep up! Nasser for Football Most Promising  Eyiram Gaze is definitely getting most promising footballer - his roommate (Emma) When you see it's raining, do NOT walk on the orange tiles! Let me save your steeze Munchies employees are paid less than minimum wage. Apparently I have a boyfriend and I didn't know  You see that thing about change your pin else it won't work etc etc.  Na scam. I've been using the same pin for three days Why ya'll act confused when you know lowkey you might like someone? You're waiting for your soulmate? Wtf, girls just be delusional🚮 If you can't handle 11:59 pressure START EARLY.
It's starting to get annoying seeing some people unable to perform basic functions as the deadline draws closer.smh Food was decent 
We are still not forgiving your failed project I heard some people have been getting it on in their rooms. I thought we're all morally upright children of God 😂 The cat has gotten too comfortable on campus If you don't win today you are still a winner😂😂 Be proud, you were nominated. Nkd and Nkunim were robbed wtf  We need to get rid of that cat  Someone who isn’t even the best player on his team won the Player of the Year? Please tell me another joke!! This was the most biased show ever Honestly some people did not deserve their awards like WTH How can you tell us that Julia is better than Enyo???  Enyonam should have been keeper of the year!!! Awindor was robbed fr🫥 First of all, who sanctioned Amfo winning that MVP? Shame on all of you for not giving it to Prince. I think Pfungwa is ready to play with the boys now How and why did netball have so many categories? They are like 5 in the whole association  Juliann won some things she wasn't supposed to I was afraid they would rob Pfungwa of her MVP and Give it to Juliann The level of the women's football here is shockingly bad James Ice was robbed  Amfo for MVP was the robberiest robbery of all robberies!!! Like wtf!!! Another year, another robbery for Prince's MVP award. It's now ridiculous 😑  The integrity of these awards was unquestionable till we got to football,  then we got to MVP Amfo. That was it for all of us😤. AFA ≡ WWE Kasanoma is by far the most loved and most supported team on campus👏 Boss Baeta was ROBBED.  Amfo, return that award quickly  Volleyball should have had more categories, I mean, what is netball and why did they have enough categories to award everyone in the association?  It's true what they say. Engineering is a cult Ustun is rigged fr🤷🏾‍♀️ Even Amfo sef, e shock am. Good defender but definitely not best player of the year. the USTUN performance was just not it, tbh  yea Pfungwa has immense aura  Where are the Career Fair Pictures please? We didn’t stay in the queues for hours just not to receive them 😑 What is going on in dufie!? Why did I wake up to a family of ants plotting how they were going to climb my face NKD and Nkunim were robbed smh, one of the biggest robberies of the night  You guys have to stop with the fucking inclusivity and admit the Nigériens are damn weird. You mean to tell me you can't clean up after yourselves, you're loud and obnoxious and expect us to be nice to you when we're supposed to live with people like that??? Come on now. It's them you should be telling to be considerate and not us"
Week 42,"Just tell him you like him already. Yes, I'm talking to you J.Joo can i just remind everyone that USTUN voting is literally not the final say of who gets what? it’s literally just to hype the program up, pleaseee. it’s like less than 30% of the final decision  why would you lie that your wig is your actual hair? ew please Ashesi, reduce our school fees and take away the destress and wellness wednesdays. we will be less stressed trust me.  I am addicted to plantain chips and Ghana jollof 😔 I’m secretly a crime fighting superhero in Paris by night and an academic weapons by day I've been suspended  I fucked someone in the kitchen. Beat sex ever!!! Would recommend 👌  Someone should please tell Tani that I like Salma ei😭 I have liked so many guys for the past 3 years, but I can't get the first one out of my mind I eat gari every night🥲 I'm sleeping with someone 10 years older than me C'25 boys have gooood dick That I like girls  A lot of you boyz are hella cute but either arrogant or too cool for school There are some cute 25 guys oooo. Doron, Alvin, Pascal, Henry, Likes.... especially the ones that hangout in 2D🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪 
None of my friends have a clue that I'm actually married with a four-year-old child. They all think my husband is my uncle and that my child is my younger brother. If they knew the truth, it would turn their world upside down,lol. this 27 girl has me going crazy  Fucked a 25 boy last week. No protection 🤪 Casa Bella has just fallen off! Nowadays they just keep the food overnight and warm it in a pack. The jollof tastes so horrible! It used to slap  There’s this girl that eats fufu everyday on her snaps and she’s like a bobby pin whatever she’s praying for, God me too Just tell him how you feel. You won't regret it even if the feelings are not mutual My friend's man is my sneaky link🤡she will never know My parents think I’m in school every weekend but the truth is I’ve not spent a weekend in the school💀 I caught feelings when I knew there was no possibility, because he gave the best relationship energy! I’ll just soak it all into these books, maybe me and grades will at least work out. Please, those who claim to have steeze so they can't participate in anything...including projects, be so fr I hope that as we are going to the normal semester, the deadlines become more reasonable. A project should never last one Ashesi week. I know I keep mentioning it, but how can my semester here at Ashesi fit neatly within a semester break at Academic City? I am friends with someone who eats fried rice WITH pancakes. There. I said it  12k for on-campus? That's two 2-in-a-rooms at Dufie Gold, I can start a business with that money! be so fr Is it The Hill Speaks if it's a few disgruntled voices? (me included👀) I've gone back to the boy Does the salma person know Tani is in charge of this😂😂 Crazy that I'm heating on my Gs girl. She's hot though🥵🥵 So hard being gay in Ashesi cause you want the babes but you can’t figure out who’s gay and who’s not. I'm batman i miss my old sl😂😂, not his personality, just the… romps sigh. my friends will kill me lmao.  i still think about that douchebag. but i really banged the door on my way out, so it’s stuck, there’s no going back. he probably hates me.  I want to kill myself but I am a coward You know what would be great to close out the semester? The choir singing 'when you believe' at the courtyard. A perfect piece  Sometimes I want to kms Sometimes, I look at people and I just want to bite them Ei, so you really posted it 😭 Tell Salma I said 'hey babe' 🌚 Is Doron dating anyone? 👀 Hunger wan kee me. Munchies only has plain rice and indomie eii I love her smile. It lights up the room. Her childish demeanour and youthful exuberance. Fuck, she has so many men who want her but she doesn't see it. How do I compete, Salma Sometimes I look normal but I just want somebody to buy me bread 😞 I hope I don’t get over-religious roommates next semester🌚 Thanks to our mech teacher for putting the die in dynamics A very big thank you to my friends, my safest place, and that annoying individual whom i happen to like. I don’t think I’d have seen a sane end of this sem without you! Thank you! We probably won’t talk as much next sem (Ashesi unwritten principle) but I really appreciate you!  Friends are really helpful….select them wisely Shout-outs to my friends Daniel and Bartels, you guys made this semester a lot more liveable 🫶🏾 Shoutout to book club.

This is the one time I’ve been able to ever pick correct proper motivational friends😭 without them I’ve no idea how I’d have been able to survive till now on this campus, even now that we don’t have the same classes I’m feeling it. I love them so much fr💕💕 Can the lecturers please normalize giving out finals prompts at the beginning of the semester??? Especially if it’s a project or final paper. Let me work incrementally on my work and be fine tuning it as I go instead of expecting me to cram a whole semesters teaching into 2 -3 weeks😭 Exams week brings out he nastiest attitudes in everyone Shout out to that 26 baddie at New Mass that gave me directions to Charlotte.

If u know u have a lazy attitude just don't join a group 
Opt to work alone 
Don't come and stress people 
I really mean it 
If you feel this applies to you, just make the change—it's not right to continue like this.
Even if u don't know show some concern 
Never and never dare to come and play with my grades
Thank you  There is sexual tension between me and my roommate.  Can the new hosanna managers stop making us carry germs into our rooms. What's all this?! In case you don't know how just continue thinking the liquid you walk in at 3am when going off campus is some miraculous spring💀 It's quite disrespectful to call me a 26' baddie, especially when I told you my name. Some of you 27s have to grow up. Lol, silly nerd Why are shots being fired all of a sudden?? ☠️ Friends are the key to surviving here at Ashesi
Shoutouts to Esinam, Michael, Awoye, Daniel and Austine I find it ridiculous how we as students are just selfish, to be honest. It’s like we forget the sacrifices that everyone had to make for this accelerated year, the staff , faculty etc ,yet we make the whole thing only about us. Most faculty would probably be on vacation somewhere but they had to stay here, teach you, try their best, mark scripts and deliver grades in a short space of time, what about their mental health? Or does it not matter? Everyone is just going through it, let’s be kind and continue trying our best. Ciao. Someone getting head at the student hangout. I’ve really been feeling this ‘27 girl but she’s known to be anti social and walks with only one boy. HMU love I have such a HUGE friend crush on Pfungwa and Kiki (Arthur's twin) like I wanna be friends with them soooooo baddddd my grades 🧎‍♂️ The most ridiculous thing on this campus is how people use others to their advantage and they make sure ,you indulge into them, and after getting their satisfaction, they ghost you, and see you like you don't even exist, some of you act like you lack home training, if you want people to use ,get them  elsewhere, stop putting people's children into stress of which they will forever ask themselves if they wronged you  somewhere yet it's your stupidity and childishness, some of you should grow up .......... Broo I legit saw this guy and his girl come out of her room, and the girl was holding her stomach the whole time I don’t know if she was sick or something else happened but her walking style was also ridiculous  Most ridiculous: Big Ben leaving 😭😭😭 
Bring back Big Benedict !!! #BBBB What if he just wanted to keep you private bruh. Can’t have everybody know there’s a baddie lurking First of all there is nothing insulting about being a nerd so the 26 girl should stop watching American movies that imply it’s an insult. Second of all, he complimented you. Relax it’s not that deep. Why should he name you? Relax pahn. Carry your body go rest  Calling someone a silly nerd because he called you a baddie is wildddd but oh well Gotta be sleeping guards 😂😂   Make the football ratings make sense. So everyone is 93+ good? Try watching FIFA or sth. We can't even repost cause it makes us all look stupid📌 A “proud” boyfriend on his way to other girls room to watch “movies” has to be one of the most ridiculous things I have seen  nothing. what’s there to laugh about 😐?? My roommate should hurry up and graduate please, I am tired The way I just noticed this boy this semester , and come to find out he now has a girlfriend. I’m in pains😭 I don’t want to want her man o, but how can I help it if the boy is funny and smart and cute and exactly my type?😭 Who is behind the ink?🧐 Still with the football ratings thread, kindly post so that PR knows👏we beg We’re in college! Read that again! All of you people who don’t wanna leave high school and keep acting like kids, kindly use the break to grow and learn that we’re adults(at least the majority of us)! Let people be responsible or make mistakes and own them! Stop making everyone feel shitty for walking with their friends or taking distances from some people or even getting new hobbies! I’m sick and tired of nursing you guys! Next sem, better change because Imma start calling out y’all’s bullshit and trust me, it won’t be fun! Also, please let people breathe, we all need grace!  I find it fascinating how some of you think because I don’t talk, I can take anything😂. Well, you’re not wrong, but it’s only because I treasure my scholarship because the depths of some people’s schemes is unimaginable😂. How’re we gonna disagree once and you take your vex to AJC masked as some serious assault? Anyway, what do I know?😂 Lowkey can’t wait to graduate and block y’all😂! Just keep treating me like crap, it makes things easier for me! Today somebody is cheating another day someone is cheating? Ad3n 💀 MENTION THEIR NAMESS!  The most ridiculous thing I've seen is people making you feel bad for wanting to stick to your Christian morals... I get it, we obviously weren't all raised the same but please stay in your lane as I stay in mine the funniest or most ridiculous thing? - my ex, that 🤡 Why are those on campus so stinky? Do you even bath or clean your rooms? I really hope the 27 girls “playing” with 26 and 25 boys are just sexually active and don’t think it’s romantic. If they think it’s romance that’s actually funny asf The number of Christian high students is actually ridiculous. They’re freaking 10% of 27. Does that even make sense. Wtf was the admissions team even thinking.  i can’t believe my crush is leaving fr. like i’m not going to see this boy walking the halls anymore??? damn it’s going to be one long boring year ahead for me  Hm. The day I connect to these Berekuso speakers erhnn.. The person talking about the accelerated semester should just stop. Cos guess who is getting paid and who is not. It’s hard on everybody yes, but it’s hardest the most on us students. Cos lord knows a lot of us could have used this summer for something . This was supposed to be my internship summer. But ALAS!!!!!! Let’s just all accept it’s a mistake that should not be repeated again  i once saw this couple kiss. ON CAMPUS. ON A BRIGHT SUNNY AFTERNOON. TONGUE AND ALL??? Awurade, this school wants to finish me I need like 2 weeks recovery period after this semester ends Is the roommate aware of the sexual tension? ""Is the sexual tension in the room with us? "" - The roommate, probably Chale all of you are clowns 🤡.These people are just trolling themselves  These Berekuso people why? 24/7 King Paluta ye People shaming other people for having sneaky links knowing fully well they want one too. Like since when do munchies call people by their food eerhhh...."
Week 43,"AUNTY CARO NEEDS A COMPETITOR. That woman will keep you there for 2 hours and smiling. Then insult you when you ask for the wrong change. Heiiii. She must be humbled. And also free that 12 year old boy she uses for child labour. And she must start wearing gloves.  There’s one C‘25 guy I have not been seeing around? Infact, for the whole semester 🥹pookie where are you?🤧 Your Ghanian wife misses you🫶🏽😭I promise to tell you who I am when I see you again.
#internationallove🇰🇪🇬🇭 How do we study hard in the sem and you bring a compulsory question one cannot even solve? This is sheer wickedness because how do I wrap my head around this, I cannot fail this course too. It's not even funny at all... You never even calculated finding Y using Disposable income and taxes, yet you bring this as compulsory which we can’t find our way around it. Macroeconomics (never underestimate this course)….. never suffered in an exam like today… The Macroeconomics final exam percentage should be changed to 20% or 25%, it’s not fair for final exam to determine whether you fail or pass(it’s not funny). Am I going to fail macro, Oh God. There's heat in my head rn. To the macro paper that we just wrote 😭😭😭, I dedicate this song to all BA C'26
""God is with us! So our great Forefathers sang."" Go home before you think of texting that boy, I promise you he has not changed  After battling with exams you have to deal with anxiety from results later. It’s an endless cycle  I have some serious crush on this girl, but she has a boy. The annoying thing too is that I am fresher and have a better personality than the boy Ei macro hm On a more serious note, The economics department really did the macroeconomics students dirty... tell me why a compulsory question will be one that we've never seen before. I was this close to getting an A+ in macro but as it is now only God can decide my fate hmm I’m gonna Miss Tatenda fr ,  After you’re done with a course, all you can do is pray. I don’t want to hear anyone complaining about things out of their control 🙏 I still don’t get this honor code thing. I thought it meant no invigilators in the exam hall when the exam starts. Someone explain 🤧 I might scream after finishing FDE  We made it to the end. I think we all deserve toffee 🥳 Dennis Owusu…hmm A huge shoutout to Doron! He dedicated all his time to help with this course, making my heart melt with gratitude 😭😭 Sending tons of love and appreciation your way 🫶🏽🫶🏽 Chale, why we dey write exams sef?😖 Masa macro 👎🏾 material science is overrated anyways🥲 you know it's bad when there's 70 objectives and you had to guess 30 why do lecturers like going 'oh the exam is going to be easy, oh it's basic stuff' when you know DAMNNNN WELLLLL you're bringing extra stuff😭 how was I to know😭 The Lord will fight for me and I shall hold my peace😭 At least now I don't have to worry about being our grades being reduced for the curve Dr Edgar really cooked bitter food and forced it down our throats 😭😭😭 What is this guy doing to this girl that she's screaming like this... I hope it's Africana o.  Me: Reading for mechanics
Guy next door: Reproducing...
Vim  ""babe, it's sem over, not love over😭😭"" That be what I hear rn oo...Ereach ur man🤣🤣 The C’25 boy is hustling in Silicon Valley. Hang tight babe, he creating the generational wealth for you  ASC needs to stop disgracing the free food ambassadors 😭 I can’t allow Ashesi to kill me o Not exam related, but there is this 26 girl. I honestly think she's the most beautiful person in this entire school. Like how can one person be so perfect. We've not met yet but when we do there's no going back. It's only a matter of time. Oh and yeah about the exams just pray and hope for the best and let God do the rest, you barb! I can feel their absence approaching, even as I hold on, pretending we have more time. The thought of you leaving feels heavy, though I know it’s certain. There’s an emptiness growing in my heart, hard to describe, harder to handle. I struggle with the truth, knowing you have to move on to something better. Yet, a quiet sadness lingers—I miss you already, in ways I can’t quite put into words . Hope it finds you well !!  Someone please tell this cat to stop giving me side eyes while l have my lunch.
I'm tired and scared‼️😭✋️ My favourite person in 27 is leaving. God 😭😭😭. I’ll miss you b 🫶🏼 Signed the honour code in first year , third year now and I’ve never written even 1 quiz without an FI invigilating. Was it all a joke? We that signed and the people that didn’t append their signature what is the difference? Thank God for peripheral vision, cos the way I’m ogling this boy, if I had to stare directly he’d probably think I’m a freak When I actually like a boy, my first instinct is to pretend the boy does not exist and loudly make people think I like someone else. Is that normal? Waakye and Pancakes?? masa masa masa…aswear chat gpt deserves a degree cuz eiii All my C’2024 Engineering fam.. I’ll miss you niggas😭. They said they won’t allow me to graduate  To the 24s, go and be living waters to a thirsty land 🙏 11:59 is no more scary. Make it 6:59!! Can someone explain why the enrollment slot is opened without any notice?!?!  This is to everyone who doesn’t get to graduate with their class. You’re still part of the class and we’ll celebrate you as well! And we’ll enjoy being with you till you also leave! You worked hard and you deserve to celebrate with your class!   Shoutout to Kwame Attrams C27. Guy has some of the hardest fits I’ve seen. Also made my life in the school a lot better.  Congratulations class of 2024! Graduating itself is such a blessing cl proud of all of you🥳 At least it's over Shout out to Hortense, Janice and Sandra. Always looking out for me. Wishing them all the best out there. Shoutout to Freddy, Man, you have been a real human being. Albert Cofie and Edward Laryea how can you do this to me😭 This semester drained me Massive shoutouts to Richard (24), Faisal (25), David (25) , Samuel (26) , Da’ud(24) and Doron …. You guys are awfully compassionate 😩, humorous, patient , altruistic and so much more. Thank you for everything and such a semester 🙏.  I’m very appreciative…. Shoutouts to all members of the academic committee !!! Palal, John, Freda, Hannah, Tehillah, Daniel, Yaa, Micheal, Emmanuel, Bless-Charles, Suzie, Eldad and Roseline …. God bless y’all for your dedication especially during such an  accelerated year and all your efforts that have gone unnoticed 👏 I'm so grateful to my power rangers for their endless love and support. Especially that one ranger who stayed on the phone with me and ran to me when I asked her to. Forever a Power Ranger To Bennetta, Yenma, Eureka, Georgina, Faith, Mavis, Chika, Makafui, Doesi, Naa-Ayeley, Ella, Ewura Ama, Tracy, Millicent … whew 😅….Majorie, Adwoa Marfo, Adwoa Serwaa, Yaa, Nadine, Nana Yaa, Cheboi….  Thank you for your kind words…humor…. and any rendered help… They got me through this partial year someway somehow Stanley, I like you but not sexually. I like how smart you are 😌 Busted my a** this semester so why is my camu looking like I just slept throughout this whole sem... Next sem I go sleep proper tswww"
Week 44,"Shout out to the lecturers who for some reason are still keeping the grades and raising my blood pressure. Posting of the Dean's list doesn't matter anymore, it hits different when it's said at during graduations. The element of surprise is so good. "
Week 45,"You won’t pay someone for a service they’ve rendered 7 months ago but you have money to start business Eii sweetie  Graduation was so sad at a point. Seeing people clap massively for those that had honors, whilst those that didn’t have any just walked by with minimum claps or cheers. It’s seems as if just their name wasn’t enough. 💔 proud of ALL the graduates🫶🏾"
Week 46,"SLE really needs to do something about this housing portal...it's not it at all One week till a new semester and academic year of stress, anxiety and pressure, so fun!

Miss them already 🤧 New academic year, same academic weapon lezzgooo Can’t wait for the creatives festival. Lovee seeing creatives in their element 🤩 This sem dier if I miss any lecture change my name o😭 Miss the 24s already. Especially the hillside boys🙈 The SLE gave some of us a lot of stress, we had to cancel our plans to rebook rooms. Kindly do better next time.  Final year I’m so ready!!! Who won the #getinvolve challenge? I will not be there, no matter what  Ashesi release my timetable 🤧 The break was the best thing I had this year. Man’s refreshed, man’s rejuvenated. I can't believe I finished first year without a lover 🥲 This semester dierr, full rizz. The academics can wait  so annoyed to be back, bro we just left"
Week 47,"“Leaving that guy, giving my friends and myself enough grace, doing school right and letting God do His thing!” That’s how I’ll roll this year!

Why is one piece of bread 4 cedis 😭 Honestly I missed the cat at Akonor 😭 Very greedy and monopolistic vendors for a so-called ethical institution!!!!!!  This was definitely not the first week. We are already in the middle whether you like it or not  If at your big age, your aim on campus is to 'look cool'. then idk that's really childish and cringe. Not participating in class/coming in late makes you look weird, not cool. This aint high school Go back to the old colours We have crushes that we always want to see but this semester #that'snotthefocus"
Week 48,"Surprise surprise vogueFinds is doing sales😲. Style Sizzle🔥🔥 take advantage.  (writing with a lot of excitement)
Seriously Tani you shouldn't have apologized, the issue was worth the wait!!
and as for Kiki and Fridah, if I fail my quizz tomorrow it will be on you because how can you write so beautifully and so truthfully and expect me to continue the prep? 
Tbh, this was by far the best issue I've ever read Is spending the whole night studying , then dozing off during classes the next day a thing now??🤨👎 Atp we should just give the ASC dues away to charity because no one comes for the events"

It doesn't matter what parliament says, the rule of unassigned assigned seats is an unspoken one and shouldn't be broken. Why are you stealing seats three weeks into the semester? It's okay if you didn't get the seat you wanted. Move on and stop making life difficult "

 These ints really be stressing merhnn There is this boy in 27. He's really tall. Cut your high top my guy🙈 Am I the only one who still hasn’t got everything together? I’ve never been this confused in all my 3 years! I got no idea what I’m doing😩  I know some of you wash you towel once a semester, why? Your roommate is probably dying in there and they can’t tell you ! Hmm. change wai🤢 What happened to the white tables at Big Ben? Please bring them back. Can we all stop pretending we care more about learning than grades??
If you claim you learned so much and the course was so impactful but you got a C, you can't lie and say you're content with that.
Stop saying what you think the school wants to hear and say your mind😒 Maame Mensah's class is actually very insightful and fun. You guys were lying Saying excuse me before loudly interrupting someone doesn't make it okay. It's just weird and upsetting. 
Also, why are you shouting? They're right beside you. The whole class doesn't need to know what you're telling them How do you tell a boy that you just want to have fun and not have anything serious and tell another boy you don’t want to do anything at all with him? ( it’s an actual question ) so Ashesi actually won’t post about the protests at all??? lowkey disappointed Patrick didn’t take any opportunity to express support for #FreeTheCitizens himself the ASC tried for us by having that discussion about stopping galamsey the way Ashesi students didn’t show up for the talk abt galamsey… it will shock them when water at Essentials is 25 cedis Ato is actually a great academic co-chair, especially when you know him personally"

You can learn a thing or two about something you admire about someone but don’t change your authentic self just to fit in some circle.  Stop with the last minute assignment submissions 😭💀 MASA mabr3 oh!! Some 2 days break no go bad kraa oh!!! Do a community check before you give that boy a chance, e get why 🫶🏾 Some muslim girls here are highkey very pretty. I've said it! The honors really no Dey need Make all say we no go write midsem cause wtf how did we get here so soon The loudest in the room is not necessarily the smartest. Run your own academic race, do not be intimidated by anyone. Sending hugs this mid semester season.🫂 I’m lowkey crushing on the dark 27 with the amazing fashion sense at hillside😩 If you see a CS student in 26, just hug the person The school is getting too boring—only the Creative Festival happened. What's going on ??? Stop chewing gum so loudly and making that “tatata” noise I really beg you It's okay to break down every once in a while.
Ashesi takes a toll on the mind and body Let me screen those breasts Are you guys just looking for oddly dressed humans for the ‘outfit of the week’ or what?! No shade😗, but the actual cool outfits can be counted by finger"
Week 52,"Someone should tell the JEC to organize a presidential debate  We didn’t want to hear Newton’s quotes but rather his thoughts. International students are once again the bait cause now we’re supposed to expect Independence Day funds from a committee that has continually promised but failed to give ISA funds?  While Samuel and Yvette have clear chemistry for the vision. Jessie is like a supporting character to Newton’s ambitions.  Newton shouldn’t have answered the question about the criteria cause his criteria was a non scholar, who’s not an engineering student and lives off campus. Are those really the key qualities Jessie brings to his table?  Aren’t we all tired of buzzwords like change, diversity, leadership and change?  i hope there’s more drama in the manifesto readings We are equal to the people we roast on the Internet if we not inform ourselves about both parties before we vote. Listen to what both sides have to offer before you give in. Peace✌️
 That question to Nana Yaw was personal. More of that during the manifesto reading please!  69.3? Eiiiii Why are you telling me that your ideal vice should be a non-scholar who lives off-campus, all in the name of diversity? Upon all the qualities Jessie has, that's what you could mention??? Damn Can people start switching off stuff they are no longer using? I have been turning off fans, microwaves, lights, and heaters since my first year. Kindly turn off items when not in use.  I used to sleep while using my pc and my roommate would come keep it for me. That roommate taught me that our room was supposed to be our safest place, and she actually made a home far from home, for the both of us. My best roommate if you ask me! I just pray blessings over her🥹❤️!  Staying peacefully the entire semester until one day she decides that she's allergic to wood, therefore the study table can no longer be put next to the bed closing the gym because of someone’s silly mistake is just like canceling a course because someone cheated. someone’s mistake should not affect my gym progress. it takes a lot to be sacrifice and dedication over there in the first place, spending 3 hours (workout, eat, shower) consistently for your progress to be cut off. then starting all over again. no!!! Everything she says has to be done, I don’t have an opinion, and she loves to bang doors that the entire building shakes from the intensity  He used to dine with dirt. On top of all that, mandem's body odour really hit different. His girlfriend moved in and I now became more of a visitor to the room  This person never understood boundaries, they were very unclean and had a weird smell to them. OGs know the one As you are reading this, I hope you know you're 'that' roommate. In another world, I never want to be paired with you anymore, even for cash. I hope you meet more people to straighten your behaviour and teach you the essence of respect, neatness, boundaries and verbal training. My roommate used to spend not less than 6 hours in the washroom so I used to joke with others that he went to Narnia cause that was the only logical explanation  The person was incredibly dirtyyy. Like did mommy and daddy not train you on how to be clean? And why would you wake up and choose to overpopulate the room with your friends, forgetting you own only 50% of the room? If only their significant other knew who/what they were dating. They deserve better than this catastrophe I understand being messy like your things are all over the place (not really but it's better), but leaving ROTTING FOOD around the room is where I draw the line My roommate's boyfr6asked me for head 🤢 My previous roommate was a lot. She was messy and loud, but she went through a lot. I hope she's in a better place now  Saw my girl today........ looking as radiant as ever. Hi Salma. Welcome back, love. I resonate sooo much with the one who said he feels like a visitor. Just don’t do that. People like that ruin the entire semesters for people. I don’t think there is a greater form of selfishness. You could do it anywhere else on the earth; why a few feet away from me??? Btw, are Tani and Salma still together?👀  Asking for a friend👀 If you're going to have your girlfriend staying over every night please get a one in a room. Some of us would like to sleep without hearing funny noises  Hats off to class of 2025; Cupid didn’t miss this time around . Everyone  is in a relationship  One unexpected night, when I had just finished taking a shower, her boyfriend came to our room, knocked once and entered (like bruuh, are a roommate now?)… bet he saw the whole of my body🥲. But the guy was humble and respectful enough to come back and apologize to me. Tell me why she got angrier than me and even started making it look like I was trying to steal her man👀😂💔. Maybe he liked what he saw, but was that my fault? lmao😂💔 I stopped using our room’s toilet because she always left both the toilet and the bathroom dirty😭, and she puts on an attitude when you mention it. I got tired of cleaning more than twice a day 🥲. Now all her friends hate me because I talked about a serious issue that could even lead to some dangerous illness!

The way she looks clean and pretty outside, I bet she deceives you boys🥲. Beware! I prayed to God to give me a new, organized, kind roommate. God did it y’all😭🙌🏼. She’s peaceful. She’s giving me a whole new energy I had never got in Ashesi for 3.0years … especially from someone from a different country as mine.
She even wakes me up sometimes when I’m about to miss classes 🥹🫶🏼.I’m not used to her yet, but she gives me a home in the room. I love the person you are, roomie 🫶🏼. 

Hint hint: she’s RA in some hostel😁🫶🏼. She used to bring all the local foods in the room, and it made the room so not for me (the smell). I’d literally come back when it’s time to sleep at night. Her boyfriend used to visit around 00:00, and they’d literally start kissing in my eyes🥲. My innocence got abused😭💔, and they made the loneliness in Ashesi hell for me 🥲. If you have problems with your roommate, you are old enough to confront them gently about it. Stop being cowards who hid behind anonymity to vent.  Ei is it the same class of 2025 I’m in? Did Cupid pass me by??? They might as well openly tell us that this is an accelerated semester too🤷🏻‍♀️.
Mid-sems are doing what they do the most-searching and sorting by divide-and-conquer🌝! Do other girls also get jealous of their friends?  Can’t wait to go home, see my dogs and my parents and my bed. Funny thing is I know after midsem will be more mentally draining and this is a distraction 🤣🤣🤣 This midsem is not a break because why do I have 3 assignments and 2 groups works to work on??
Might as well just stay in school🥲 Can people please stop coming to our rooms to sell clothes ? If I wanted to buy some I’d slide in your dm. I struggle with saying no so you at my doorstep just makes me feel like I have to buy even if I don’t want to Ashesi midsem is basically not going to class. Cos tell me why I have so many submissions during the break😭😭😭 There’s a degree only God can fix💀 Is it even a midsem break when I have papers right after the break? Some people are allergic to certain animals and wouldn’t even want to be around them, let alone eat with them nearby. There’s been a cat hanging around Akornor for about two semesters now, and it feels like no one’s doing anything about it. I’m not sure if it’s the ASC’s responsibility, but something needs to be done, frfr. This midsem , can A+ just start from 40%   I’m just tired
-from the the bottom of my heart chewing gum like it’s a grenade in your mouth😭what at all?? Men who don't understand that screaming and thrashing isn't the only way a woman expresses that she doesn't want to be touched
It doesn't have to be rape to be non consensual  Rn dierr wherever I pass, tuba sheshe  guuurrllss, EmpowerHER is cooking a some girls event in November 🤭 Some of y’all are academically intelligent but also emotionally, socially and morally unintelligent and backward. Sapiosexuality___ well understood after stepping foot in this school Oh icks? Lemme put mine on the table 

For the love of God, stop making people feel bad about their financial status. Like we get it, daddy has money but have you got any? Exactly. Sit down As a guy why should I be seeing your boxer shorts when walking. I should only see it when you’re about to sit on a dirty surface .  No entitlement here though, but can those who have rides during breaks allow some of us join them? It is so difficult getting a ride out of Ashesi😭😭. now the exam is over and my head is clear…. i just realised our potential JEC Chairperson used a cheat sheet to answer vetting questions😭 conflict of interest no? All midsem breaks and Ashesi Air 🫲🏽……….🫱🏽 It’s tiring …. 🥲 Call me weird but I stay stalking his meal plan on that website. Like what did you eat bae? Bad breath. Can we start shooting our shot here🙂‍↕️ i’m crushing on that dark FI. he used to play football and goes to the gym as well. yum yum yum🥹 You’re in 26, tall and lightskin with pink lips. You usually wear earth tones or black. You have a Nana in your name 🙈. Need you. But unfortunately the people you hang out with are terrible 25 boys. Yes that squad. So I know you’re not good either. But maybe you can prove me wrong??? There's this tall dark handsome and funny guy in 27, he's in my stats class and I think he plays a sport,  probably basketball or volleyball. I want😭😭 I need a man to rock my body Brown. No description no long talk. It's Brown Class of 2025, Blonde braids (with those curly ends), girl squad,  banging body🫶🏾 The girl in 27 w the cute face ,who studies BA,who is about 5’1,sometimes wears glasses,I have a huge crush on you. Her name starts with “A” ,she’s in 27,one of the cutest people I have ever met,walks like a model,her hostel starts with “T”.Her smile is so pretty.I wish you were mine I’ll treat you like the angel you are. You’re the language I’m no longer fluent in but I still remember. Come back please 2025 white civic coming for you🙂‍↕️ Light skinned engineering lady(2025)…got a man? Someone asked me if I liked you, and I told them I didn't. But from how giddy I felt when I had to look into your eyes, how shyly I couldn't hold your gaze, how I had to mask my nervousness with giggles, to how I went to bed blushing from remembering the moment. I can, without a shred of doubt, say that I like you in fact, I do more than like you.               	
My plantain chips, I know you love bread. So, Can I share the space that bread holds in your heart?
 There’s this girl in C’26, cute, used to have a pink hair and currently having just 3 braids on. She gives me a stubborn girlfriend vibe, can we be a couple?"
Week 53,"He has a girlfriend chale , so what’s the point?😔 Met him in class for the first time, and his calm, deep voice and composure got to me, but what could I do except flush it down! Later, he came to me at the gym (was about school work), and when I turned to listen to him, the only thing I saw was his physique—the height+the chest adding up to his dark skin. Like DAMN! For a second, my 🧠 shut down that I didn’t even hear what he said😅. But heyyyy, from that day, I can’t workout in peace when I meet him at the gym… the only workout I wanna do is 👀 at him. Yet it gets harder for me to workout when he doesn’t show up coz he’s, apparently, managed to temporarily replace my “why”😭. So powerful of him.
But the guy’s so nonchalant🥲… tell me why the only thing he can say to me is Hi😭. After catching me staring at him more than 7 times (his presence has a way to suddenly steal all my attention), all he can say is Hi😭?
Extra confession: I don’t want a lot from him. I just want a lil talk (get to know each other) and his warmest hug🫂 for now. my Patooti Patooti, he’s got the AURA STEEZE COMPOSURE UP in the clouds!!🧎🏿‍♀️ She’s in 26, studying Engineering, fair, slim, and a bit tall. She mostly wears white or African prints on Fridays, and on Sundays, she wears scarf to church. I think she attends Pensa. What fascinates me most is that random smile she gives when she makes eye contact. She has a beautiful smile, and she always smells nice too.

If you see this, just know that someone notices the pain in your eyes, even when you smile the brightest. Oh, and maybe cut down your screen time, you’re always on your phone, even while eating. If only he knew how much I wanted him to bend me the f*ck over. Those boys in 25, usually in black. They’re so cute and have so much aura😍😍😍 The 26 guy that takes the donuts orders is so cute🥹 That cute girl in 27, fair and cute. Her name I think Dani....., do you have a man. When we asked our roommate why she wears her sleeping clothes to class without washing nor drying them. She said it’s because she wants to. Till this day i am spooked, a whole girl and that time she’s so pretty.😭 Not a horror story but washing in the laundry rooms at 3am would have you seeing and hearing things  The only horror story is what this boy decided to do to me. Hmmmm!!!! Need a girl like Maame in 26 in my life Most terrifying experience is that where you couldn't tell if you were sexually abused or if it hadn't gotten there yet. That feeling of dirtiness, hopelessness and not knowing what to do, who to talk to or whether you should actually say something is the most dreadful ever.  ""You can't do this in my car"" actually used to terrify and creep Ashesi girls out 💀 it's about time we addressed that man Some evenings around 3 am I could swear I hear someone screaming for their lives  Dave(26) I want you. Leave your girlfriend for me. I am willing to give you anything you want. I’ll destroy anyone who gets in my way😡🫵🏽 If you like someone... just go ahead and tell the person. You'd never know, maybe your relationship status might change, like mine! 🥹 I need a lady who can cook well in my life>> How can you tell me you're ""still learning how to cook indomie well""😭 Chaley, some of the ladies should try to help the boys resist lustful thoughts and imagination. I want to focus during my class o, but my mind revisits the reveals of your dress😩💔 Hmm I was walking from munchies to the school gate at like 12am. There was NO ONE around and it was quiet. Theree norrr I turn and see a dog tailing me. My heart dropped and I felt steam leaving my body. I think the dog felt my fear and ran. I didn’t even sack it oo. It just felt my fear😭😭 Why do I feel the article or whatever it is is biased….??? 💀😑 If the ASC wants Newton, what shows the election can't be rigged to favor him Please tell me why you decided to approach me in freshman year, when I was just minding my business, made me fall and just ghosted, like c'mon let's be real. There are better ways to begin new chapters you know. What happened to the midnight walks😫and the kisses on the forehead? I miss 'em all😭 Foine dark C’26 girl. Vibrant “model”. Mann… been craving me some more French hugs. I love  a ""books are better than the movie"" ass nigga

An ""imma intrinsically analyse this one film and then yap about it"" ass nigga 

A ""persistent Pinterest pin curator"" ass nigga 

A ""loves impressionist art"" type nigga Don't listen to your friends or people to make a decision in your relationship. They won't be there for you when things go south. Be wise. Everyone in the school are just hypocrites.  Bro where did the midsem break go??? Looking forward to spending time with my roomate again. We got closer this sem and it’s the best thing. I love you Akosua A. 😉  I’m excited for Love Inc’s Thursday services at 7pm at the Hive. Always helps me unwind and keep God at the center since it’s been difficult to do that at Ashesi Definitely not excited about seeing ashesi boys Protecting my GPA with my heart. May this semester end as fast as it started
Amen  Looking forward to my three exams🌚 Feeling good but the fact that his girlfriend is coming back 😔 no I don’t look forward to anything hope this helps 💗 Be warned. This is not second half. This is a whole other semester☠️ I actually feel anxious for the second half because  hurricane Milton can not even be compared to the force of the academic workload coming up. Chale hug any ‘25 engineering student you see around.  Hummm back to seen her without approaching her🥲 The assignments 😭😭 Can we have another week😭I don't want to do this again My eyes ache from the weight of unshed tears. School’s just gonna pile it up more and yet my glasses are so good at hiding them. maybe after the break i'll see the one   
Seeing guys shoot their shot on this form has me laughing. No wonder some girls act like they're the prize—big egos but still fragile."" 
Some people act like they’re cool until you see how they really are. The hill is full of try-hards.  ei you just broke up with your boy and you’re entertaining a new boy ei🤣"
Week 54,"EmpowerHer should cook something for us😭. We’ve been starved😭😭 I pray you stub your toe on the sharpest corner of the wall. And I pray your laptop gets spoilt a week to exams. And I pray you fall down at the archer courtyard during academic break or wellness Wednesday. My gone but never leaving love,

May karma never find you, coz the way you’d suffer, herh🌝

I hope you find another one, but much better than me, coz at least I’d feel like you were worth reducing my standards for!

My love for you never dies, but it don’t matter.

Now I’m deeply falling for one of your friends, and I hope you never get between us. What you’ve cost me is enough, boy🥹. Don’t you take away my other love of my life. You were the first, my before, but I deserve a happy after😭. God will punish you  Hey Ex😎, I have missed you😂. I have forgotten the past and that’s how soft I am🥹. But I want to teach you a lesson because I have not forgotten the emotional torture🥺. My plan is to date you again and this time around, make you fall hard for me, then on my birthday 🎉 I break up with you😂. I love you though🥰. WARNING ⚠️ watch out and be careful 😎
 To my beautiful and amazing friends, and my even more amazing boyfriend, I love you all to bits and I don’t know what I would do or how I would navigate this school without you all! May God bless and keep you all His new girl is hot and beautiful asf so happy for him( friend of an ex)  She still checks my IG and socials to see how I’m doing. B*tch! I’m winning. To that one boy...

I found some old maps we drew, but the paths don’t lead anywhere anymore. Just a reminder that the treasure hunt turned into a maze, and I’m tired of getting lost. Keep your compass; I’m charting a new course.   You’ve mastered the art of ghosting while pretending to be a ghost yourself. It’s impressive how you can act like everything’s fine when you’re really just a coward. Hope your new life is as empty as your promises. That light skin girl with the hard fit in ‘26 I need her baddddd GIMMIEE GIMIIE 😛 we don’t talk about kingsford  Where was Adam, Mouctar, Generaly, Jacob. Willy was clearly tired but they can’t sub him out💔😂😂 but they sub Mumuni for overlapping. God save the school team. I don’t think the volleyball people should put up the net again. Always inconveniencing us futsal players and then going ahead to embarrass us like that🚮 Was the Ashesi coach playing favorites? I don’t want to mention names but some of the people he played were very questionable considering there were some much better players on the bench That goalkeeper is single-handedly responsible for our loss ACity center halves 🤌.
NB: Can't win all the time. Sometimes you are good Sometimes you are bad. Next time take the chances(score from the set pieces) Our support system (ashesi) is very disappointing to say the least. I mean come on guys. The crazy part is that when you're cheering for the team people be looking at you like you're crazy. Social cohesion my foot! Anyways congrats to the Basketball guys. Football lads another day it will workout innit  That academic city commentator(female) was just talking straight up SMACK like shut upp😭😭ah she was just dissing our team. Sooo unprofessional. Such a pick me girl mtchewww get a life That goal keeper eh. He probably has a girl in Academic city ✋🏾 because eiii. He’s the reason we lost. How aren’t you in the goal postttt. And for the penalty, he was just there like 🧍🏾‍♂️Ei not even a leg tilt I don’t get why we allowed that white individual from Acity to talk trash on the mic while she was in our home. Like tf. But she to she is very Jon  To the Ashesi football team, 👏  Ice and the team, I take my hat off to you guys. Adom my eyes are still watching 👀  How can we lose to ACITY so embarrassing  Someone please explain the connection between Twi and noise because l don't understand why some people just become so loud when they start speaking in Twi."
Week 55,"Nobody:
Ashesi students: Lecturer, I want to say it in my own words😭ah Those tall dark A City boys though 😍 The Maame Dankwa girl can take all my money🙏🏾 Another day to see people who deserve awards lose them because of votes and popularity. ASC fix it wai, have better criteria than votes only.  i decided to say “okay” for a change. Okay to the boys who keep buzzing me for talking stages and whatnots; and girl let me see - he was caught off guard, fumbling, speechless and you know that glimpse or scent of fear and insecurity in a man’s eyes? I saw it, growing rapidly almost engulfing that young lad, maybe let’s start saying “okay” or “yes” for a change, i’m still waiting for him to gather himself 😂; tsw  um, it’s not it THIS YEAR I honestly don't feel like going because my crush rejected my invitation to Ubora. I don't plan on going with anyone but her, let alone myself. This Ashesi community is embarrassing to say the least. Acity came here and it felt like they were playing a home game. Where was the crowd? Where was the support? Guys, ask that girl you’ve been eyeing to be your date!! This might be your chance. 
Bring back old romance!!  Can we make #Uboraposals a thing pleaseeeee
Like promposals but for Ubora🥹 Ashesi sports culture is dead Please let’s be guided with this ubora thingy.😔 No come pressure us ooo.  Let’s talk about maturity !! A lot of Ashesi students lack that and it shows in their mannerisms- especially boys 💀 Talk about why classism is a real thing in Ghana- especially in Ashesi and how respecting people regardless their backgrounds should matter more than their class- “As you go up, you will meet people coming down; as you come down, you will meet people going up.”- life can surprise you and turn the tables. Ashesi students dey see demma body pass. Make some noise then everybody just dey there. If you're won't show some support why bother coming in the first place. PLEASE IF YOU'RE NOT COMING TO SUPPORT YOUR COLLEAGUES, DO NOT COME! What's the point of proudly saying that I am from Ashesi if our students don't support each other in front of strangers 🥲 Chale you know she has a boyfriend but you're asking her to Ubora? Some of you set yourselves up Uboraposals🥹❤️ Bring back Tanko parties. if you see an Entrepreneurship student, hug them and give them 2 billion wai😭 How are we going to be sure that the new ASC heads will reduce lateness in events? Because it is critical oo
 is the reading still tomorrow? haven’t heard any communication from the asc after the posted the schedule MIPS assembly language? kwerh. didn’t understand anything. anyways I’ve already put it on my cv after the first lesson I might look fine but deep down I know something suspicious is going on behind these elections😒. Grateful to the JEC for saving us from bush politics. Seems like the only student body doing their job.  DO NOT KISS YOUR GUY BEST FRIEND. DON'T DO IT Kiss your male best friend  Guy there's this one FI eh, just let me graduate first. He'll be mine All that violence from Maritime so unnecessary cause ah???? Are you really coming to fight because you can't play well and it's showing? Like please find somewhere to sit, it's embarrassing for you. They can have the trophyless win since they want it so bad. Please next time Acity should be the only school allowed on our campus 🙏🏾 I don’t know who handpicked the other ones 🙄 Lock pfungwa up and keep her somewhere safe. Shout out to the little ball boys! Watching them help out and run after balls during football games makes me smile, God bless them. Ashesi school teams and winning🫲🫱 So why were the Maritime boys fighting? Was all of that really necessary? It was fun to watch though so I'm not complaining. I love the love Ashesi students have for their Campus to go to that extent, Man 😅😭🤣🤣. Anyways, I really enjoyed yesterday's Bb's game. Go go Sugri, Sean, Trueman, we are proud 🥰 The acity’s pen was too soft🦦 Who the hell designed the pictures for the UBORA nominees? Apologize to the whole school. Disgraceful  So proud of the Ladies🥳❤️ Alvin the goat ~ His old roommate  Why did they use Elikem's middle name? I honestly wouldn't have known who that was My baby boy is finally getting his flowers?!!! Go Eli boo ❤️ (reply my texts) I guess I can't say Elikem is underrated anymore  Ask all the nominees to share their hair routines with us. I want to see what Elikem says I don’t think need I to say this
But in case you don’t know
vote for FRANCINE wherever you see her name🤝
Trust me…She’s put in the work💯 Vote Johanna for sportswoman of the year
I don't know what sport she doesn't play in this school 😂 The girl is good 🤍
She is amazing 💯 One of the funniest yet most annoying events of the year ngl 😂😂😂 I really can’t agree with the person who said Maritime didn’t play well. The game was very tight and could’ve gone either way. Solid number 9 for Maritime Chilly Pepper Deep 6
William  8
Chichi 10

Injuries won speedy recovery to Chilly 
We need you bro. Clearly it shows.
 The boys should stop making it look like “Football is all about them” and learn from the ladies. More investment into the Women’s league🔥🔥.."
Week 56,"How can you give the (Ashesi)guys medals and leave the ladies who won? Is the Sportscom serious? Just as the guys invest time and energy into football trainings so do the girls, stop making fun of women’s football( before I start mentioning names😡😠).. The games were nice hey, especially basketball , oh i even met my soulmate from Maritime 😍 so fine. Glad i came to watch.❤️🥰 Those that start saying hello to us because they want votes?? Wtf?? So unethical. I will vote for you because you deserve it not because you greeted me. Be for real. The A-City boys tho😋😋 VOTE FOR ARTHURRRR!!!
(Whatever category, if you see Arthur just VOTEEEE) Player for player Ashesi>> Academic but match performance Acity >> Ashesi  Another stellar performance from Acity. Well deserved win. Solid back line including Jamal the Goalkeeper  Deep down I feel if we played Maritime in the final we would have lost😕 From coach to bench warmer 👌
Glazing Acity at the moment  Huge respect to center back Soke🙌🙌. He missed a tackle and gave a penalty in the early minutes and as captain he didn't let his guard down. He appeared more resilent and stronger in the air and on ground till the end and despite the penalty miss in the shootout. I respect him for giving his all.
Bro to bro I wish Ashesi boys had the same passion and didnt rely on vibes and complacency  Sportsman of the Year, they should give am to that nigérien guy Harouna..the guy did a fantastic job in sports this year. Kiss whoever you want to kiss. Think about consequences later. She hates herself so much and it simply doesn't make sense to me. She's the kindest, smartest, most beautiful girl I've ever met. I really wish she could see herself the way I see her. She'd love herself so much if she did. Dave and Elikem should be the only ones there for Tech Wiz! Which other pretenders are those? If Daniel is going to mention the Career Fair competition win, Elikem and Dave won that in their very first year in Ashesi, so big deal. Most importantly, they know how to have fun Yes it’s been a long time since we broke up,
Yes it’s embarrassing I can’t move on,
Yes I wish we worked out and I didn’t have to love from far.
But in all, I pray I find life again. I’m only joyed I am the half of the tale that goes through this while the other is free with a life again. I hope the ink posts this and I hope my ex sees this.
The cost of us has been paid with my repute. With the finishing of every letter grade on my transcript. Maybe truly fate was to blame Your recent post said that boys should stop acting like football is all about them and learn from the girls. I mean sorry, the girls didn't get medals when they deserved them, but what do you mean learn from the girls?💀 There is nothing on a football pitch that a girl in this school can teach any boy. Even your best player would be bullied by the worst bunch of random Engineering boys in this school. I've been here for 3 years, I know what I'm saying. If you watch Juliann well, she actually deserves every category she is in right now, that girl can JUGGLE a lottt  I’m so glad I met these 2  men, life suddenly makes sense. One is Jesus lol.  This girl broke my heart fr, we were literally sisters and she ruined it and I don’t think she even cares, lol. Girls can be weird.  Bring back UT cab! That’s the only way I made it for my 8ams in first year and second year i used to go to class. in third year now, i go to lectures. i see the difference now Star Image? It's gotta be our shortie, vote Hilary guys 😂 If I had a cedi for every time there's been a comment about Elikem's hair on the Ink, I'd have 2 cedis, and one of those would be bright pink 😂  You better stop filtering this shit The Weather outside is Rizzy
But the fire is so skibidi
And since I've gyatt to go
Ohio Ohio ohio  Half of you girls want to be approached, with your faces looking like koobi Where is Ozeba? I SAID AMAPIANO WOULD DIE! WHY ARE CLASSROOMS SO COLD😭I can’t even pay attention to the lecture without freezing my brain Shoutout to vigilante 
Tell us more… Vigilante is causing chaos 😂 And all of a sudden, Akornor is trying to improve their services  Wouldn’t have bought the doughnuts on Saturday if it wasn’t for that one girl Can we have the game ""Ashesi women's team vs. Engineering boys"" that the so-called sexist talked about? Petty boy..lol  Please we want to see what's on the paper🥹 Little Missy be talking about aura and steeze basically all the time but simple flushing the toilet and leaving it clean for the next person she can't do😒🚮 We love Hallmark but the waiting time is insane 😭😭.  They need to do a one on the screening process to become an FI, because some of them do not even want to be here fr  You pay 170 for jerseys and two months into the semester they are yet to be delivered. You ask around and no one gives you a straight answer. AFA style up ☹️  Hallmark’s jollof couldn’t beat our beloved “Big Ben”😭😭.. The jollof was great! Thank you SLE💕. Hope they don’t change. And I think with time they will coordinate better to reduce the waiting time. It’s a fresh start, let’s have patience 🫶 Where the huzz at? I've bought only fried rice from them, and it was actually pretty good and a lot, but the wait time was way too long, I guess they're still figuring out their rhythm. 
 Joseph Adjei should be sacked. He is not fit to be a lecturer in Ashesi. Lacks communication and leadership skills for a school that champions such values If you're coming to give me a quarter of a plate of rice, do it with your chest and stop giving me vegetables I didn't ask for to make it look like you're not They should worry about the stress and confusion. They’ll get used to it. I just hope they maintain their quality. Also they have to scale down their menu😭😭😭. I hope everything works out well Suspect needs a new roommate. Am I blind or is that Micah twice? You guys I can't pretend anymore I'm hurttttt😭😭 and she's so perfect, it makes sense he would pick her over me. I would pick her too.
""She's so pretty, she just sorta sparkles. I'll never sparkle"" I don't understand why we are being so stingy with the ubora pictures???  Some girls are just ugh. Your boy will come and talk trash about other girls to you and you’ll start to hate the girl because of what your boy said. 98% of the time, the boy is just a liar and couldn’t get the girl. Let’s be guided girls. We’re all we have.  Tired. But I'm into it. Christmas is almost here. That's all that matters Suspect’s been going to classes for the whole semester but only trusting God to help answer every task assigned. Suspect must switch courses, what is this? Or rather switch schools.🙂‍↕️ Do you love me back? Please why is Hallmark making us pay 5 cedis for a small paper cup? What was the egg doing inside the rice ball 😭🤧😂💔 Yes, I love you back. Chale you'll seriously be thinking about your COA exam on Tuesday and be seeing heartbroken people on the Ink. Everybody and their problem wai"
Week 57,"Suspect is toxic  Suspect is addicted to his close friend. Their relationship is now complicated. He might be in love with her Go back to 10 slide posts Suspect is lowkey into her gender but she has a man😂 suspect is gay Suspect has a crush on a boy who wouldn't look at her twice Suspect still believes she’ll find true love in this Ashesi Suspect can’t wait to graduate  Suspect wants to go on a baecation but she ignores all the guys in her dm🥲 Pathetic to see smart Ashesi students only do assignments and learn for quizzes. We only get to discuss assignments and next submissions. No life, no passion discovery, no skill development. Didn't expect this as a freshman. Was Ashesi all hype? Did I make a mistake?  I just confirmed empty barrels do make the most noise! That C26 Nhyiraba girl doesn’t know anything but always wants to make decisions for people. Bro!!!!!!!! I'm with her right now, and we're both silently using our phones. Where did it all go wrong? suspect is always late to class  Suspect will not join the boba tea craze 🙏🏾 hallmark it’s been less than a week and you’ve reduced the sizes of you’re crepes ?you’ll pay for your crimes 🫵🏾 Shorty so thick she like a hardware and systems fundamentals exam paper We didn't last long. 
Unexpectedly, like a storm appearing in the middle of clear sky 
With no build up 
No foreshadowing 
You called it off 

It hurt ngl
But on second thought, in those few days I was really happy
So... thanks for that
I guess if I was going to be with someone for a few days, 
I'm glad it was you. 
Have a nice life! Linkin Park songs are speaking to me on a deeply spiritual level Suspect is looking for the huzz At least you get to silently be with her on your phone. We don't hang out anymore, I feel like I've lost my best friend He’s in 26. He does M.E. He’s not Ghanaian, he spoke to me once and his accent gave me chills. He always has some strict look on his face so I don’t even know how to go talk to him. Shout out to him!! Ashesi is way too censored Shoutout to Kirk🔥 Shoutout to my mannn🥹😆.

Maybe it was his nature, and not his choice To all beautiful and handsome men, we cherish you our ribs🥰.
Girls all men are not the same 🌚 Shoutout to my favorite Jomens He asked me to buy him something at essentials and I said “let me see what I can do” ✌🏾.  To the guy I met at fab lab x03, please try being a bit nicer to people, okay? I gave him an attitude cause he got upset with me for something I did to him.
#Womeninsassymalefields You are literally the only boy I talk to! When he asks me to post him on my Instagram story but ''I don't even use Instagram like that'' 🤷🏾‍♀️ He only ever saw me as a friend. I told him  I was okay with just being friends.Long story short. I ended up ruining the friendship.
#Womeninmalefields When he catches me with my bestfriend, so I tell him ''believe what you want'' He ended up venting to me in a text and I replied with ‘I’m just a chill girl, type shit’ When he ask ''what are we?'' and I reply with ''do we have to put a label on it? #womeninmalefields When I tell him I don't want to put a label on it, because label ruins things  I accidentally cheated on him and had to beg him to take me back with tears in my eyes. I missed my grandmother who died when I was 6.  First time my bestie introduced him to the friend group we told him she’s never felt like this before and we’ve never seen her happier. 2 weeks later we were saying same to her crush.  He said he used to play football in highschool so I asked him to name the Real Madrid XI from 2016.  Saw him at the gym doing a deadlift so I went to hold it for him and suggested he remove some weight lest he gets hurt. Saving the Ashesi community 🙏🏾.  I cheated and sent him a text that starts with “it hurts me more than it hurts you.” When he wants to bring up something I did so I tell him that women like peace in a relationship, you may be handsome but if you’re not respectful and you’re not my peace 🕊️, it’s a difficult for all involved.  The time I lied to him that I loved him so  I could sleep with him #staytoxic The girl with the blanket ......... hw far? I called him dramatic when he expressed how he felt 😎 He said he couldn’t be loyal, so I let him go. Now he’s out here auditioning for a role that’s been recast. #WomanInAMansField""
 My relationship🙏🏽 Attrams 🙌🏾 that nigga won’t sacrifice an opportunity to put his friends on… more creatives should be like that When he asks what his role is in the programming project and I tell him to proofread the final report

#WomenInMaleFields I knew he liked me but as far as I’m concerned I don’t so he can be there🙂 You know what would increase engagement? IF THINGS STARTED ON FUCKING TIME
FOR FUCKS SAKE  Being asked to explain something and then refusing to because they’re a boy and they just won’t get it.  To the guys that are bleeding in Ashesi, we dey for you. The temperature that some people put the AC on is so inconsiderate. If you are cold when it's on 26, go and sit outside. Don't come and put the AC on 31 as if you just stepped out of a frozen lake.  Rigging ustun then rigging ubora, that’s bs  I thought my ***** would be there, I got tickets for my friends and I, and he wasn’t there. He’s the M.E guy in 26 from the last time🥲 I think it's unfair to tell us to audition...tell some of us we can't perform because there are limited spots,then make some of your friends who didn't audition come and perform... Why is everything looking forced 😭😭 Pleasee we beg. Bring Blacko for the next Asc week. nahhh the second set of Macs ATEEEEEEE Nah the second set of MCs ATEEEEEEEEEE single people have failed to breathe yet again😪 Last years own was better in terms of everything . The red light at this one was too much ei. As if we're going for rituals Johanna's voice was so sweet OMG I go start learning French too. This song was amazing 😍 Noo dis one here, know say dis might not reach am but chale, dat international girl in red kill am die! Lowkey, she's a GOAT The most boring event I have been too tbh. Next time should be better and more engaging  The seating was not done properly..we stood the door for a while before anyone bothered to  seat us 😪 Mina minks? Deserved fr(anyways book her she can do it for you)  Kimberly's look was🤩😍👌 Can't tell him in person, but he absolutely A-T-E it! He's in C'25 doing CS. Kimberly Taj was robbed of the female best dressed award ngl  We hadn’t sat down for even up to 10 minutes since the event started and they were already announcing awardees. No build up, no anticipation. It was giving  “announcements” but everyone played dress up  This semester things cast oh I once got stuck in the bathroom while my roommate and his girlfriend were seriously going at it I listen, and I will judge all of you one by one I step on the cat's tail anytime I'm the only one around it

We listen, we don't judge Anytime the UBORA nominees came to solicit for votes, I lied that I had already voted for them


We listen, we don't judge, because we all did it I used to have sex with my roommates girlfriend  Had rltnships with 3 guys last year, then decided to stop dating for new year resolutions. Right now, I have a crush on my ex’s close friend and tryna make things work out with us. Mind you I just broke up with another guy we started dating earlier this year. Besides, I’m crushing on every calm, tall guy I meet, including my FIs. We hear, we don’t judge, but we help a mate😭"

November/December death ain't cool, right?
January maybe? After the festive season? Talk to that girl  Don't prioritse people who don't prioritse you. If they find another person or group more fun to hang out with, never get to the point of begging them to spend time with you. Please respect yourself and move on. You deserve better! Leave.  Why did you leave God to try and handle it all alone ? STAY AWAY FROM THAT BOY PLEASEEEE Put more effort into your academics and make more friends who’ll help you grow better  Sleep wai.

You have four years bro, not one month Don’t take things personal. Work on yourself and take little steps everyday to get the results you desire. Atomic habits count. Learn to let go and don’t hold grudges, better to be free than to hold on to people and situations that cause you pain. Be yourself so the people looking for you can find you Make a lot of friends especially outside your course Enjoy yourself  Partyyyyyyy Don’t date ashesi boys frfr cos eiiiiii? What if I am drunk bruv ?? If you're struggling in class, don't struggle alone. Get help!!! There are so many people willing to help you succeed  Be yourself.

Loosen up, reply those guys dms and get yourself a present man.
Thank you Stop playing Don’t date any cs boy Ashesi FIs must go to hell. They’ll spend the whole semester not marking attendance and choose to do it only when they notice that someone is missing. Mark the thing everyday, don’t come and spoil our records by making insignificant things significant. Why do you think we have free misses?  Can’t get Love me Jeje out of my head… it’s literally been a week since Ubora, that girl owned the performance  Come for prayer conference 🫵🏾🫵🏾 Wigs are so much stress  Can we talk about the double standards in Ashesi? 
ASC can’t play music durong programs during school hours , but when the program includes staff, to hell with the rules, just look at the noise from the drums on Friday. Smh, ethics where?  Please let’s beware of the on-campus apple charger bandit Just heard about the passport events for the 27s. I think it’s a very bad idea. Forcing people to go to events never works. I guess that’s why the participation is so low I think people should say who they think has nice braids and who doesn't. It's possible some people haven't heard the truth yet. I said “yoo bro” 
He said “hi” 

Eww Must I always have to borrow from the next day?? 
 This is a Christmas break not a vacation… We deserve rest too!!!

Can't wait to be there😌 Okay, I get it: I'm an engineering student but did I really have to be a lifeless grade-chasing academic zombie? Yay, I got the grades I wanted but here I am almost done with second year and I barely have any fun memories I can look back on. 2025 better come with a load of wild adventures and unforgettable moments cos I'm done being just another stressed-out student. To the 28 girls. When you come, make sure you find a boy in 25 to study and pray with🙏 So we won't get the pictures of UBORA this year??? Abi next dem go come take again. To that one fresher... I promise we don't bite. Some of us have rbfs but like we're really chill people😭 🫦 Honestly, study. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you you’re doing too much. Learn. At the end of the day, you will know you are making your parents proud and making use of your school fees. It is a cannon event for you to get into a situationship with a senior in your first year. Know that it is not going anywhere. Don’t be stupid Guard your heart cos we are coming

Prepare to be stressed  Avoid 25 and 26 boys like the plague. They will come for you like the predators they are, but run.  Don’t date Ghanaian women 25s boys are  EVIL, 26s boys kiss and tell( they can gossip herh ), and 27s are just distasteful in general, focus on your books don’t let pressure catch you  Don’t put pressure on yourselves. Trust the process ❤️ Don't be under pressure because of the lifestyle on campus guys, not all that glitters is gold☺️🙅 Maintain your standards🙏 Don’t succumb to the ashesi status quo. Be as free as possible, have as much fun as you can. ❤️❤️ Chaley word is simple... Studies, Sleep and Chilling - you can only have the best of two. Choose wisely lol! When you go to Ubora don't take pictures cos them no go send am to you Never undermine your potentials. You are here because you fit in. Pray, be optimistic, work hard and smart, and be respectful. You might suffer at the beginning and even doubt your potentials; but through hardwork and persistence, you'll get to the end successfully. And, it will all make sense eventually🫶.  To the C’28 don’t neglect your spiritual life oo🧏🏾‍♀️ Ashesi can deal with you in ways that only God can help see you through. So please find God if you haven’t, find a church(I recommend KCF😊)and be consistent there. Enjoy the journey. Have fun and make lifelong friends don’t let anybody’s son or daughter stress you 😘 Don't be pressured to be spiritual or religious if that isn't for you. Find your own path. 
Explore. Do what you want. 
 Chale Ashesi is cold oh kwerh😭😭 I don't want to scare you but Ashesi is scary. 
Welcomeeee ☺☺ Welcome huzz🥹 Dear C’28, I don’t know what you’ve heard about Ashesi being fun, but it’s not; you have to make it fun for yourself. Know this and know peace😌  Run away Chill within this orientation week or never get to! Ohe step at a time. Build the right habits and repeatable routines early. They'll help you sale on autopilot when when your drive is down. Build a support system from which you can tap help and provide help for others. Go beyond school work: your value lies beyond your academic scores. Intentionally have fun. All the best Stay away from the 27 boys please. The school in itself is stressful enough  Welcome to Ashesi is a warning❗️But enjoy orientation🌚 28 girls, stay away from the 27 boys😭. They’re thrifty though Ran away 🤧 Stay away from Gilbert Tetteh If you’re doing CE just stop. Go to CS Stay away from Caleb Atakora  Be open hearted and minded… you can get and feel the best from this campus🤎.
And congratulations🎊… this’ such a great achievement."
Week 64,"I don't know how best to say this but you have to pray and study. Go beyond your grades. Your first year friends might not be your ride or die, it's totally fine. What matters is having people who align with your values. Don't compare yourself to others and fight imposter syndrome. 
Ashesi is not fun. Relationship might work or not. Just make sure you don't lose yourself Your fight is against a system 28. All that glitters isn't gold. Just make sure you are on the right track and get mentors early on. Keep good friends and be as social as possible.

I’m dreading just thinking about that place let alone being there.  Sleepless nights😭😭 Minding my business😘I hope we all learn to do that as well I beg, you don’t need to know everything🙏🏾 The engineers were such a vibe. Arguably the most sociable people I met at Ashesi. Massaaaa, bring the c27 boys, we are ready  One if the 24s really changed my life… she would always sit and listen to me rant on how my life was hard for hours, mind you, she had capstone going on and other courses worrying her. She taught me to be me and showed me how to let go of some burdens. Trust me, she’s been a strong pillar in one of my best transformations. She made me befriend so many people. In other words, God really used her to work some things out in my life. I really don’t know how I’m going to live in this same school with my ex way back from Christian high. I think I still have some feeling for him when I see his muscles 🤭🤭. I’m just a girl🙂‍↔️ I really don’t know if I can stay in this campus as a fresher with my ex from Christian high. I think I still have feelings for him and I heard he’s at hosanna 😭😭 So you applied because of CRAZY DAY 🤣🤣. Wow, all the best To my dear gentlemen who use Ashesi's washroom facilities. PLEAASEE!!

Week 65,"First day of school and we’re being harassed for ID cards? Are the security men looking for new jobs on campus or what????

You don’t even need to have a romantic partner, it could be your friend group, study partner, situationship, talking stage, sneaky link, side nigga… CELEBRATE IT WITH SOMEONE! Can the ASC do the Cupid sendit on snap again please🥺 Can the school plan some fun activity for people who want Valentines to come together and shoot their shot or something?  This year my girls and I are having a little galentines date. It's not everyday boy boy‼️ Text me babe😔👉👈 Dodging all the arrows 😏😭 It really is because we are breathing love-filled air on Campus🥹❤️❤️ At least l get to be part of the shooting😌 Eih, then these arrows have sedatives in them paa oh, I feel like sleepwalking😭😭😭 Ashesi Basketball Association, letting the girls play for 5 minutes is a complete insult. They were there to play a full game. This is unacceptable and reflects poorly on your sports program and LEADERSHIP!  And what the hell was that female coach in red doing? The ref as well!!!! Where was her support for the females team? This kind of pathetic ""leadership"" just highlights the blatant gender discrimination Why would they stop the girls basket ball match at less than 3 mins???
Then we talk about inclusion!!! smh😑 We were playing basketball and some guy in 2025 with braided hair and beads at the end stopped our game abruptly. We are trying to advance an agenda where girls can be partakers in games and activities outside of academia but how can we do that we we are not even treated with dignity and respect. 
The guy in question stopped the game and said we were done playing when we asked why he repeated the same thing and when we tried to talk some sense into his faulty reasoning he spoke about time and the games starting late 
Now it was not our fault as we were at the court way earlier 5:30 to be exact and we waited for our turns to play 
We were pushing the agenda further to continue our game on the court and the guy was rude to us 
This form of injustice for the mere reason that we are girls or that we are just starting in basketball is not good at all 
How then do we leave a legacy of female basketball players 😭 Quite interesting to see how far back some people’s mindset. Gotta be a darn achievement , here’s your trophy. The idea of girls not being as good as boys in sports is an archaic thinking some people still seem to hold dear to their heart. Oh well, let’s give thanks to God for a good night. Less than five minutes of gameplay for women basketball, quite discombobulating. Didn’t know that was a standard in a basketball game. Why is there gender disparity in the school when we claim that there is gender equality. This is why most girls are not encouraged to play basketball in Ashesi. The sports committee should do something about this.
 Ashesi Basketball Association, where is the inclusivity? Girls have been asking to play, but you’ve never wanted to include us. Why did we have to fight just to be heard? We tried to form our own club, but it’s like our interests were never taken seriously. 

 Making people play for only 5 minutes is beyond disrespectful. Is this what fairness looks like at Ashesi? The lack of support for girls in basketball says a lot about inclusivity and representation at Ashesi as a university. This needs to change.

 To all the girls who love basketball: Your passion deserves recognition. We shouldn’t have to keep fighting for a seat at the table. Basketball is more than just a game—it’s a community. Excluding girls from fully participating takes away from what this community could be. Most boring interclass final game ever!!!!!!!  Equality in sports isn’t a privilege; it’s a right. Ashesi prides itself on being inclusive, so why isn’t that reflected in the Basketball Association? Girls deserve the same opportunities to grow, compete, and thrive in sports. Why is this even up for debate in 2025?

 Do you know how heartbreaking it is to love a sport so much, only to feel like you don’t belong? This is deeper than basketball—it’s about respect and dignity. Let's remind the guys in the ABA that they're playing for fun,and they're not getting paid, so they might as well respect the ladies and give them space to function. Seriously did not expect such behaviour from Ashesi guys especially with all that hardwork put into our curriculum concerning gender inequality. I pity 'his' parents though😪 The leaders of Ashesi basketball Association should think of their leadership twice ...some of them are just disappoinment, they are killing talents .....😏😏 Letting girls play for three minutes and stopping their game is crazy....Mr watso ever who stopped the game u better sit down and think of urself  Education system is stressing  us ...and yet you normal human being u want to stress people too in basketball for real.... The referee of today's basketball game...eat those balls to urself😏😏u could at least give the girls a chance to show what they have  Please can't ladies start approaching boys since we are in an inclusive environment? 
Saying I love you to a man won't kill anyone.
We are tired of you ladies sending us to our fellow men. Talk to them by yourselves. Enough about the ABA. Can we talk about roommates with partners? Just because your roommate is okay with your partner visiting doesn't mean your partner should make the room their second room. Remember, we all paid for the room. Mid January The Ink still dey rep Christmas hat😂We also miss the Detty December chale😪 Dating someone who loves you and wants to date you>>>>

Week 66,"But like sup with the Mr.Ebo guy. He'll be telling us to read the computing materials but will use lecture hours to teach us about the milky way and galaxy. It's getting out of hand.Something tells me teaching computer science was his second choice. Am I safe or? Is this a Ghaniain culture or I am in a wrong circle?, someone monitoring all your moves, when and what you eat, when you wake up, what you do when you wake, when you read, how long your alarm is.

Run the city by Cindy(uganda) change your life - Fireboy DML  and JIGGLE & WHINE - Stonebwoy (feat Spice) Everyone should put that shy, ""I'm new here"",""I don't know a lot of people"", attitude somewhere and have fun.

Thank you. Pbee - Space Can someone please tell the school to slow down with the emails? Emails are for formal communications. Why are you using it to promote businesses or some AFA league? Can we have a separate group or something for that? Clubs can do that. We are missing out on the important stuff I grew up knowing that women speak a lot and have no secrets but Ashesi  boys/men have proved me wrong. Oh can’t we become men again?? Guys can talk 🥲🥲🥲🥲
 No line will work if she’s not already interested in you. All my life, I have never been someone's valentine
ahn, did they swear for me 🤣🤣 She's not a bad texter
Or a bad talker 
She's not super busy 
Or asleep early
Or in church 
She just doesn't like you bro
Move on I might not have rizz, but what I do have is a big lonely heart waiting to feel loved. Shoot your shot,cupid got nothin' on you hun😏 This one Hallmark server serving more attitude than food Hallmark should take a very big step back from serving a whole portion of jollof and 2 portions chicken in a burger pack.  Honestly, the way to a girl’s heart is through her friend’s heart. Boys please buy your girl’s friend chocolate too😭 She’ll take care of the rest😂 Yall should be confident and ask her outttttttttttt😉 Walk up to her
Look DEEEEP in her eyes
In Gru's voice, go ""hey bebi GORLLLLL""
Smirk
Now turn and run away yelling ""IT'S DONEEEEE""

Watch her fall in love Remember; rizz is 80% vibe, 20% words. Just be confident. Unspoken rule... Do not overly confident as a rizzler! I just know people are coming to type nonsense 😭🤚
Please just be gentlemen this is not high school or middle school 😌👍 Just dress well and smell nice but don’t suffocate us with your perfume or cologne, we beg Jon. DJ Kiki was the only memorable DJ. THE BEST DJ😍...also, these DJs should know there's more to life than Amapiano that we've been playing since last year January. And please don't allow that last MC to ever stand on a stage again. So irritating and cringe😒 Chale best night of my life, has altered my brain chemistry 🙂‍↕️, created new core memories chale forgettttt😝😝💥 Don Nortey did his thing! Shout out to every other performer as well🫡💯 I just went for food and it was good especially that khebab. They should come again. The vibe was there and overall it was a good night. Looking forward to more events by the ASC 😃. Honestly, alot of the mixing wasn't impressive. One of the best Akwaba Night since I came to Ashesi. 
Welcome class of 2028 Kiki ATEEEEEE ZOWNNNNNNN Don Nortey killed it!!! My favorite DJ of the night Best night ever, looking forward to having more nights like this. 10/10 experience for reallllll It was ass. Absolutely loved Akwaaba night! I enjoyed every bit of it, kudos to the new ASC I made love for the first time on Akwaaba night! Don Nortey cooked🤩 I am sorry,not to be mean this akwaaba night ,the committee no try at all ,talk about the DJs, what was that all about,, if you are holding a real party, change the way you play songs ,they are not inviting at all... let's do better for ASC week ,.."

Men, men, men, listen and listen good
This valentine's day, it's not ""the thought that counts""
I heard that some of you don't intend to ask your girlfriends to be your valentines because they are meant to automatically know. 
Please think again. Put effort into the proposal. Don't just say it, for the love of God, don't just use words. You have 364/365 days to do that. Go all out. Make her feel special. If you can't afford something extravagant, a small, simple thing she likes or has mentioned before is more than enough. It doesn't cost a lot to attach a note. 
Just SHOW her that you care. You've told her enough. 
Good luck! A simple, cute card with some cupcakes 💋 Don't ask at all Prayer👌 Through her friend😭 Have pure intentions and ask out  in a cute way,a way that you would like to be proposed in.🤭 Be straightforward 🤣 Walk up to her and ask 
""DO YOU WANNA BUILD A SNOWMAN?""
The worst she will say is no
You both will laugh
If it doesn't go right. By not asking 😒🥱 A Vals-proposal just like the way they do Promposals in SA. I don’t even need too much🤭. Slide a note in my bag telling me how you feel about me. Then slide another one asking me to be your valentine. Talk to me like I’m your valentine from the  till valz day. If you want, we could continue too🤭.  I honestly hope this boy will read all the ideas you’re going to give him because the way he doesn’t care kills me. I also want to call him my man but he’s too careless. Guys/Girls please advise your friends😭.  I want to make this vals day a special one for my man but I’m scared everyone will say I do too much. I promise I love him like that😭. But I guess I’ll just sit here and plan it out in my head. How I want to order him a very masculine package and remind him how much I love him because he means so much. Why do I want to give him a small gift every day from now till vals day?😭 A girl can only think. This and more!(**sigh**) Don’t ask! Just show up on Valentine’s Day with a box of Chocolate and like 1000 Cedis!! We girls love that! ❤️ Ask in private😂 Don’t do it Put your head on my shoulderrrr
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight, show me
That you love me toooo Friendship ghosting is not cool...maybe we shouldn't have met?"

 He gave me dark chocolate with sea salt😭 Someone tell her to PLEASE break no contact  I was dating 2 guys at the same time😪
So the one l loved didn't get me anything but the one who loved me got me a Money bouquet and a human sized Teddy.(I hope you get it😉) To cut the long story short, l posted the gifts from the man who loved me and ended up losing the one l loved🥲 He didn’t make his move before valentines, so I bought a cake for myself on the Val’s day in the name of self love and this nigga came to eat the cake with me😭 very shameless human being!

Very demure, very classy 👏 Tbh, what was the point of the sending the form for our questions if they weren’t answered? A lot was said but it’s the same thing over and over again. For a school that talks about being time conscious, they don’t practice it. And yes why would a grown adult not pick after themselves? Are you a baby???

Stop playing and call me, I'm on my knees😭 no but what if the ink isn't really anonymous Let's put ABA and AFA aside, girls participation to come see their own girls play is very low but at the end of the day it's the Associations fault. Wow🤲🏾 It’s a man’s world, nigga. I mean if people aren't passionate about it then it can't really survive. Nothing much else to say. what do you mean the people who don’t participate don’t want to do it again ?? this is the case every sem,  that’s how girls are ,but every AFA i’ve seen since i came to this school will always do something about it , reducing the pitch size , new goal posts, reshuffling, etc.. but this AFA have just kept quiet and they are watching the hard work of other year groups go to waste. What are leaders for ?? When something is going wrong do you sit there and watch or you do something  Most of the girls don’t want to participate in the sports here in Ashesi, they don’t even support their own and then they proceed to blame the AFA ah? How can a girl’s team have a match and they don’t have the starting 11??? if you are serious will you do that?? masa they shouldn’t blame anyone, they should encourage themselves to engage in sports that’s all.  Honestly personally I don’t care about sports weather male or female, so I was never going to show up for any event but if I were to show up I won’t show up when I know the game will last 3 minutes 😍 Women’s Football should just be separated from the AFA, we the ladies will just handle our business, period !!! I am scared that girls won't take sport seriously after C'25 and C'26 leave  Honestly, I believe that the Kasanom team should be dismantled and the players shared amongst other sides. 
Other teams are scared to play against them because of their dominance and this makes the league one way. And so that hinders participation as well  Honestly, there's not enough support. It's like in the shadows. We say oh inclusivity but then we're not pulling our weight. Like bro. I want to learn how to play basketball right? But then, the motivation isn't there bc I'm seeing the state of the women's basketball here and I wouldn't want to put myself in that position at all. Hats off to the ladies in all the sports teams out here. There is women sport in Ashesi?💀 I have a lot to say… but to the person saying Kasanomaa should be dismantled, do you think this is primary PE where your PE teacher forms teams for you to play just for fun??? Please be for realll😤😤. Players have the freedom to join the teams they want and coaches too try hard to contract the players they want on their teams. This is real life. Wake up from your dream bubble. The person saying they should dismantle kasanoma doesn't understand football. If a team is good, the team is good, point blank period. A great team shouldn't have to be dismantled just because other teams can't match up to that standard. A better way to put it is to loan players, that makes much more sense that let a team suffer at the expense of others what kind of silliness is that I feel like this AFA hmm. When it comes to girls football they forget the art of communication.  Personally, I don't think the AFA should be blamed. Its easier to blame those in charge than for the actual participants to take accoutaility. When most of the girls' team are as disciplined as the boys' or at least look interested and the AFA isn't doing anything then I think we can blame them then The current ASC lacks innovation. This whole destruction started from the top. How do you make promises to build women’s sports and end up choosing only men for the sports com position. You figure say words be action💀lmaoo Dear 28s...
Can you please be a little considerate when you're having you little meet and greets at night. You can't be making unnecessary noise at 1am while some of us are trying to sleep or study.
We understand that you guys like to catch up and all but PLEASE at 1am???😭😭 Players, coaches and the authorities need to understand that football is a competition. A team was trained enough to compete, same way the others should. You can't punish a team for living their dream. It should only take it's builders to break it down, not some AFA.  Can we end this discussion on the boy's and girl's football like most of us don't really care especially the girls stop blaming the AFA people I've seen firsthand what they do and it's a lot soooooooo if the boys and succeeding and the girls aren't but the AFA is doing the same thing they did last year I meannn ate they to blame and those saying the AFA should put in more effort to make the girls interested and come for practice like huh???? If they don't want it do you really think the AFA can do something?  Tsw this isn't Disney please we can't sing kumbaya and we'll all be happy  This AFA thing has blown o, you people should wait let me get my popcorn first This AFA thing has blown o, you people should wait let me get my popcorn first Excuse me AFA!! Are you okay?
Do you know the amount of time some people have invested in these women's football teams e.g Kasanoma. STOP THIS NONSENSE!! 
Some people are really passionate about this and you just come here and start saying absolute nonsense. All the trainings, all the matches won, all the injuries, all the comebacks, Chaleey! We are not playing games here.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Guys , If (samuel and Yvette) asc presidents make this ASC week flop eh , hmmm 
you better prove people wrong and make this the best  WHY DOES THE LIBRARY ALWAYS SMELL?! I’m sick and tired of this! What is that smell? Is it the bathroom? It is actually appalling. Especially on Saturday nights!! Please do something about this! It’s ASC Week, so dress extra we beg. We love to see beautiful colors on campus🫵🏽."

Can we have inclusive music on Friday We need to start a discourse on DJ Fadda….. The 28s are the best thing that happened to the Ashesi party life!!! Opening night ate so badddd It was good, maybe do the food tasting for longer next time, or start earlier so everyone is included. The Zimbabwe food was sooo goodd. I’m not even kidding  W day! I missed the cultural dance display cause of the rain but other than that, it was a fun day Saw the Mauritanian girl and a guy from cooking around 2am heerh tchaley the food was so nice. I don’t remember the name of the dish but they did really well.  Ivory Coast was one of the best 
The food, the outfit, the culture, the country itself is a vibe 
Congrats Ivorians 🇨🇮 It was fun, agreed. But what is going on in hostel 2C? Why do we have to fetch water now? Why do you provide us with water during class when we don't need it, but then there's none when we do? With all the money we're paying, why don't we have access to water?

 Everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess Yess, black Saturday 😭. Like why is a rubber mask 150 cedis? But seriously though, I think it's precisely because of people like this that school spirit dies. Are you the only one with ambitions and a reputation to keep? We all come together to let loose for one day in keeping with school culture, yet you make zero effort and then complain when you are judged.

If people sneer, it’s not personal. It’s out of frustration at your attitude. Reputation matters, but on crazy day, no one cares, bruh. If you’re that worried, get a full-body costume or something and don't kill the vibe. School is boring enough already Jenny is fr spitting. But also don't take it to heart. If you have confidence in your decision don't focus on this perceived judgement, but rather learn why they really think that beyond surface level reasons you may assume. Still 100%, live confidently in your decisions and don't make people's validations about you a priority at all. My problem is with the “reputation part” It makes it seem like the rest of the community is incompetent. ASC week is for both the student body and the faculty, it’s a period that brings the community together and shows school spirit. A chance for people like yourself who are “uptight “ as you say, to let loose and have alittle fun because life can get so serious that sometimes we forget to do that. Team spirit It’s actually an important value to have in the corporate world cause you honestly never know where you’d end up. 
Sure no problem, we respect your decision to not partake in any ASC WEEK activity or at least try to show some enthusiasm about it but don’t make it seem like the rest of the community is uncivilized and immature, talking about “I care about my reputation” and making it seem like the rest of us have none. Quite frankly it’s downgrading and belittling.  Jenny’s pseudo-intellectual essay (spark notes next time pookie) just highlights the condescension people who claim to not participate because it’s ‘just not their vibe ’ always carry with them. You can’t expect people to hold space for you when in the same breath you’re disrespecting their choices. A lot of people never participate but are good sports about it. If you care about your reputation that much, that’s great. It’s not our duty to cater to your lack of enthusiasm for school related activities (school approved I must add). And a lot of the points made weren’t well thought out, you may have just wanted to rant and that’s okay too. Hope you had a better time this year than the last, but allow people to have fun without subtly positioning yourself as morally and intellectually superior.  Such a dramatic think piece, and for what?  Dear 28s, never stop bringing the party energy even when the school starts lashing you. We need you activeeee 🔥 I agree with the revenge of lecturers part. Petition to create a law that allows students to actually have their way for the one week a year we’re supposed to pretend like school isn’t killing us slowly? I honestly think Jenny is the biggest hypocrite because why are you saying people are criticising you for not taking part in ASC week but at the same time making nasty comments about those who do participate?(Do you even know you insulted lecturers with your Crazy Day insult?) Let's hope your next critique has some growth in it. If you won't participate at least don't act like the people you dislike😇 See me my only issue is that if there's a party and you're coming to stand around, I beg, just don't come. You really kill the vibe because others are dancing and enjoying themselves and you look to your left and someone's child is just looking at you with a blank stare. Stay in your room if parties are not your vibe and allow the party animals to do their thing. If not, when you come, come with the intention of vibing a bit whether you know how to dance or not, you'll realise how much you'll enjoy yourself.  The person who typed their confession is just bitter chale. Talking about playing “inclusive songs” ei masa should we play Fela Kuti or something? Is it only ghanaian songs that are played at those events .If you don’t want to join ASC week fun because you feel like it’s not nice for you omo just exclusive yourself o it is not by force masa. There are other students (also international) that enjoy the ASC week more than some of the locals (as jenny will say it). i’m very disappointed with what whoever it is wrote chale. Trying to make niggas feel bad just because she doesn’t feel right about it.  Very valid. I side with the person wholeheartedly. I’m not going to look at you weird for cross dressing or whatever because it’s crazy day. There is no need to call me ‘Jon’ or whatever other silly term you can come up with if I don’t want to take part in the tomfoolery. Some people just don’t like noise and chaos. Imagine a lecturer drives from the other side of the town to come and have just one class, and you just ruin it because it’s crazy day and you feel like doing what you know you shouldn’t ideally do. How? How? for someone upset at being sneered at, she surely sneered at those of us who party… i also care about my reputation oh, sis, i’m not the circus clown you think i am Let’s be real 🤣, Partey’s bodycon was insane😅😅… man wey get small waist 😩 pass me  Ong no one cares that you decided to be the odd one upright person who has reputation . But don't come complaining that there's no community or it's not nice if you even refuse to partake. Staff members , faculty and even the dean and Patrick partake in crazy day but you undergraduate is the one with the reputation at stake? Okay. This constantly complaining about inclusivity matter is so ridiculous to me ( the ink I beg please post this). Inclusivity means we are adding you, inviting you to share in what we have, learn from what we have to offer and experience the culture with us. Being an international student to me is more like doing 8 study abroad semesters instead of one. You should be looking to learn and partake in the Ghanaian culture so when you go back home you have an expanded view of life. Whether you like it or not, Ashesi is a Ghanaian based school that you chose to attend  , that has made more than enough effort to make us all feel like we belong , and not in the sense of "" oh I belong because I'm familiar with it"" , but in the sense of "" I belong because this is something new that has been shared to me to partake in , I am welcomed in like an owner not a guest ( ei this is getting long o but bear with me). Realistically speaking, if we went to the party and every country had their music being played one after the other, the vibe will be very strange . (My opinion). So maybe we can take it up with ODIP to organize home away from home parties for y'all, but what we have here is access to Ghanaian artists and Ghanaian djs. Our asc dues are unfortunately not enough to fly in artists from Kenya and djs from South Africa. But what we have, we share with you and invite you to partake in it. Come to the party, dance with us and give a try to see if you can develop a love for what we have to share with you. Realistically, you are not home. But in our own way, we still want to make you feel welcome as though you were. So share in that with us, and let's stop complaining and begin to appreciate the new culture we've been exposed to and the new perspective we have been gifted with. We all listen to white people music without qualms , why draw the line at Ghanaian music? If you don't have access to the music you want, come teach your dance partner the dances from your country so you both can dance the foreign dance on Ghanaian music. Create the inclusivity you desire with what is available to you. It won't be handed on a platter ( PS : the ink I've put much time into typing this let it show to be posted I beg) Crazy day isn't only just about wearing cartons and trash cans on your head . It's about inclusivity and community.   It's the one day everyone looks relatively on the same level, and lecturers and staff lose the scary aura attached to them by virtue of their positions , and you get to freely relate to your dean of school affairs on a personal level. It builds the community , builds friendships and makes it easier moving on for you to approach people and school authorities about matters relating to school work because "" this is the same person that wore a carton on their head on crazy day and said "" oh darling Jesus"" with me.""
And so If you choose to segregate yourself from that community by being "" the odd 'responsible' one out"" , you should be ready to deal with the consequences ( the side eye looks) , because every choice has a consequence. No one is asking you to rip your clothes and walk tattered , dirty and semi-naked if you don't want to. What you only need to do is show a desire to be part of the community. We are secluded from the rest of the world( in a way) on this hill, and if you don't bond with us, who will you bond with? A little effort goes a long way. Have a presentation? Pack your "" crazy outfit in your bag and change after class with the 15 mins interval. Nurse Outfit too risky for   Your reputation? Layer it with a cloak, inner top and cargo pants. Scared to do something? Wear a mask. You can do what you want, no one will question you. For many shy introverts, crazy day is the one day they have a reason to go to the admin block and interact with staff, or talk to that one crush they've been thinking about without their anxiety threatening to swallow them alive. It's a beautiful day that everyone is happy and reminds us that we are not slaves to the grind and we deserve the right to be carefree and happy too. So let's all learn to appreciate it because I really love crazy day. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. ( please post this the ink. I really took my time to think and type 😭) So Maame Mensa Bonsu, Patrick Awuah , Coach Evonne and all the other lecturers who command so much respect, will respect for them reduce just because they participated in an ASC events? Are you implying events are degrading and rip one of their self dignity? If one of your friends tried to get you to participate forcefully, that is between you and them but please do not brand the participants of the ASC week as people who do not care about their ‘reputation’ just because you so hold on to something fragile. If the prices last year were too high for you perhaps you should veer away from branded clothing and new clothing and stick to foose and bargain. A lot of people did not pay full price for what they bought. And yes, they were sales but perhaps you were too blinded by your own delusion of things just being wrong and not up to your “standard”. And the comment on culture just defeats your whole argument on opening night, do expect. Who said you have wore short skirts to go for opening night? Didn’t you see people in bonnets, hoodies and even sweats? And you realize that the other 50% non-Ghanaian population is also very diverse in its sense right? Do you expect the ASC to fly every single non-Ghanaian artist on a very restricted budget to come and perform just because of “inclusivity”? What about pop culture day isn’t inclusive? What about Family Feud isn’t inclusive? Writing a whole article just to reflect and project your own personal insecurities is crazy in itself, and it’s what actually makes you lack a reputation. On that note I will be submitting my own take soon “Confession of a free-spirited student”  Kudos to ASC for the lovely week. But tell me why we have 2 global Cafes? One for Ghanaians and one for internationals? Why then do we have Ghana taking part in the international Global Cafe? Yes they can come and celebrate other countries’ cultures but for them to display twice (on both global Cafés ) is not fair. We want them to come observe and appreciate the same way wr observed and appreciate their own . Is that too much to ask for? Or we are in Ghana so everything should be Ghana? Well Miss Jenny isn't wrong with some things she said but I'd disagree with somethings too. The Black Market thing is a total rip off but as you said your wallet went unscathed so it's a choice. Yeah you're right that 50% of the population consist of international students but then again there's so much ASC can do with their budget. Especially when it has to with  inviting artiste. We'll expect more from me cause I'm still reading her 13 slides
Adios 
But yh she's also not wrong on how the ink selects what to post.
Pen name: Abɔdam EL in 2025 is crazy  ASC really for wise up. wtf??? El!?? Why would you bring us EL???
Someway pahnn I think it's high time we international students try to undersatnd that this is Ghana. Complaining about not playing your country music is unfair. Imagine they play a Shona song, it is only Shona People who will understand that it's not a Ghanian song. So let's just get used and eat what is served. Atleast I heard my country music and we are two people from my country. Some international students talk too much 💔, what again should Ashesi do for you guys? Should they bring your respective countries to Ghana for you to stay in it then😒? Life is never this deep if you don’t want to participate fine but don’t think you can stand on some high horse and shit on others. The S in ASC means STUDENT so all the many people who make these “forgettable” events possible are just like you stressed , overworked and unique. If you can do better I beg you to try Tsw. I have one question: Who went to attack Jenny like this? ☠️ I genuinely want to know who cared enough to tell Jenny to participate. We genuinely don’t care. Jenny, for someone who doesn’t like ASC week you seem to be very fixated on it. Even more than the ‘party people’. “If I don’t remember it, then it’s a problem”. 1400+ people in the school, grab a seat jenny Somebody ein last asc week then you go go bring Kaesa lmfao Jenny, chill. Jenny, what’s really wrong? We are here for you. It’s ASC week, not Jenny week. We don’t care. “I really don’t want to participate and everyone who judges me for that is crazy”
“They should play my music taste the whole time so I can participate”
“Cultural day is… cultural”
- A clown. Yes so hmm, first of all, what did Frida write? I’m so late to everything loooool Stuck up definitely I fooled so hard on crazy day so Jenny says I'm aimless & Tullow won't get me a job in the future yieeeee i'm shakinggg ooo but did you think 1nri would give you a shirt for 20 cedis?? bsfr + stick to your budget"
Week 76,"Confess my love for this one ‘26 boy but I don’t know how he’ll see me after Tick tock! Time’s running out. Are you making a move or are we wrapping this up?? 🫠 I wanted to tell her like you. But brooooo. Imagine my reputation if she says  nah. Ain’t by force she gotta say yes. But the nah brooo. Mental😭 This is not about Jenny but at black Saturday, the person selling jewelry who lied to me that my bracelet won’t change colour, the Lord is watching you💀it wasn’t Amerley btw  I wanna be able to get blackout drunk and say things I'll regret later Date multiple girls at the same time. Reputation ke? Please it’s a free world o do whatever you want Tell this boy I like him😔 I have a serious crush on some boy, but because of steeze I never approach him. I don’t  even think he knows who I am. He’s always frowning so it’s even hard to approach him on campus. If you are seeing this I want you😭 I fear for the mental health of students in this school. If things stay the way they are, I see a case of suicide. It's just too much man. 🥲😔 Ah hw3 I can say anything o. My reputation still stands. Who’ll come and catch me? What do you mean munchies is selling the paper bag as well? 8 extra cedis just to get food as takeout is diabolical. I understand we're ""helping the environment"" and everything but this is ridiculous  Dear TikTok,
I admire your brilliance, a fun little app that grants today’s youth with the digital dopamine they desire. Structured like a slot machine, it keeps them scrolling as their minds subconsciously wonder  “Oh what next!” As they swipe through short form videos that have no correlation whatsoever. I really do admire you.       
You subconsciously shape the views and opinions of the youth without them knowing, pushing propaganda you wish to share subtly into their never ending assortment of videos.     You sell them products they  do not need by carefully boosting the view count  on the group of individuals on your side contributing to this crime, making sure to mix it in with contented designed specially for them based off of research and tracking. Ensuring the video ultimately shows up on their “For you” page. The only truthful thing about the app actually, a feed meticulously crafted with algorithms to maximize the time they spend interacting with you. You keep them performing a specific set of actions for hours on end. DOUBLE TAP, TAP Once at the mid right of the screen and scroll through and most importantly The CENTER SWIPE to reveal the next unpredictable video. Hours of their livable life a day wasted on a rectangle cause an app demands their attention and is designed by humans who understand humans and make sure humans can’t deny you. 
I admire you I really do.  
BCC: The millions of users on the now number one free app one the Apple App Store. Idk about the play store tho.
Love.

Week 77,"Great in many regards. I don't feel like I belong but that's not anyone's fault. Just circumstances. Otherwise everything is going well To the ink : Can y’all let “ Jenny “ rest? Like we get it. She voiced her opinion. Many didn’t agree. People responded, then you went on to do a video on it. Common. That was a stretch don’t you think? 

There was more on ASC week to talk about. Some questions you even asked us to fill but didn’t post. Your whole page has become a “Jenny” spin off. Abeg rest  Yvette(ASC president), If you ever lack a place to be in, you have two places reseverved, one in Heaven and another in my Heart. 
To cut the story short, the woman is so nice. DO NOT TELL THAT GIRL YOU LIKE HER Remove fde from the curriculum. It’s a threat to humanity. It really deteriorates our mental healths. Would have enjoyed the subject if it wasn’t for the many assignments and quizzes they give us . Back to back . To the lady that has a crush, I might know you. A hello will do. I don't bite😊 This semester has been great emotionally, spiritually and academically. I can now confidently say the abridged year is what actually messed up my gpa because tell me why I'm doing so great in a normal year hmm The hill speaks posts have slowed down to a trickle 😢 do yall need help? Girlll, which class is he in. The girlies can help you get to him and free tips too 😁 This is to the boys, one in particular: please, it's not by force to braid cornrows wai🙏. Some of you are rocking boneless braids confidently let me not lie. Ei so just like that we’re writing exams. I literally JUST ARRIVED😭😭. Ei so Ashesi every small thing nor, quiz, mid sem exam , presentation, final exam. Ei if I had known dier hm. This accelerated year dier someway oh.  Fuck exams, I want to go home💔😭 leaving campus at midnight cause you're studying is horrible 😭😭 this is the calmest I've ever been about exams A peaceful stay at home is the goal so pass dier we all go pass well.
Somebody shout POWER!!!!!! Honestly I can't wait to get this over with My exam prep strategy? 😒
Stare at my nonexistent notes, hope for osmosis.  Actually it's graduation I'm thinking about. Knowing numerous students I was cool with won't remember to call me in for a picture.  Depressed. Not just because of the exams,but life generally. If I ever do something nobody expects of me,I hope you all understand. This whole thing is overwhelming. I hope my family forgives me. ""Why not talk to someone? "" You ask? What difference would it make? They know it hurts,but they won't do anything about it even though they can (And if the day comes,if the hour comes, I'll drop it all here as I go). Doesn't always have to be light at the end of the tunnel, 'rest' could work too. At least you'll join the dots afterwards and it will all make sense.

Respectfully,
Me. Bro I’m tired of the shit people on this hill  Do yourself a favour and skip entrepreneurship for capstone. I’ve met some terrible people. Just do thesis okay, just you, your supervisor and God for your deadlines. No one to make you feel like shit, when all they do is tag along. Be wise  Taking your life is the weak thing to do. Deal with the shit In the end, the life you are living is yours and God’s. Once you realize that life in general is not that deep, such as school, family, work, etc., when anything happens, you won't be fazed because it’s one of those things. Look, there is always a period in life when you are in a dark place that feels like you can’t escape. But you will always come out of it. Put your trust in God alone and not man. Live for yourself self, not others, and find joy in yourself. There's more to life than what is around us. All the best 🌟  Sometimes you look to others to validate your pain, and when they don’t see it you think the world has come to an end.
But look within, the power you will you to end it all can be converted to the power you will use to change it all, to change your circumstances.
Look within and try and find ‘the Still Small Voice’ beckoning you to hold on and give God the chance to show you how good life can get.

I hope you hold on and fight for a better chance at life not for your family or anyone else, but for your future self. Life is hard but this is the test we are going through. Dear, just find someone you trust and talk to them. I love you although me nah know you.  Please eat something. So sorry you’re going through this.  My dear brother/sister, I know things feel heavy right now, but please remember that your life is a trust from Allah. No matter how deep the pain, committing something dangerous is not the way. Allah's mercy is greater than any hardship you're facing. Reach out, hold on, and know that this storm will pass. You are not alone. Allah is always with you. May Allah safeguard and protect you. Trust me I'd prefer you talk it out and get help that do something that will hurt us all and your loved ones. Pleaseeeee just don't try it🙏 it gets better i promise. life’s hard, very. but trust, a day would come and you’d be so proud of yourself. for what you’d ask. you kept swimming. Please don't do that to yourself. Trust me I've tried and it's not the funnest thing to do. The regret after it goes crazyyy. I don't want to be that guy but then think about the people who will be affected after you have just left from their lives. Ppl say that the world will continue moving even after you leave but then it won't be the same for your people, like the people you are close to/with. 

Think about fun things, sth that will take your mind off of it. Do fun things even if you want to sleep ah sleep o don't let you hurt yourself like that please I beg. I don't know who you are but I just want you to know that we've all got this and yeah. Shit now I'm sad. Please stay 😔🙏🏾 First off all, it’s completely understandable and normal to feel depressed. Try to look on the positive side of things. Sometimes even when it seems impossible. Count your blessings.Life will definitely continue throwing so many obstacles at us. But just know you are not alone. Take deep breathes. Start again from the top. We got this❤️
 And this second message in particular is for everyone else. Once in a while, hug your friends and tell them ‘everything will be okay, because we’ve already made it this far and overcome so many struggles, we can certainly pick up ourselves and do it again, together.’ You’ve got this. Even the darkest nights end with sunrise. “keep going.”❤️ Everything seems overwhelming: trying to figure out what you will do with your life after uni, thinking what would happen if things don't go as planned and not keeping the expectations our parents has about us — it's all stressful. However(ashesi effect lol), there is one thing we can always do, just to do our best and leave the rest to God. If we surrender all to Him and believe, everything will be fine. He is good all the time :) Can someone advise the Hakuna guy(Moses)? "
Week 78,"sending love and prayers g, do take it upon yourself to see any of the counsellors, they're trained to be of some help to you🙏🏾 The first ever dream you had of your life is staring back at you with thoughtful eyes. Meditate on that scene and find peace with the fact that your imagination is your reality. That first dream.  It honestly doesn’t need to be all school and I say this as someone who does the work. Do the things that make you happy. If you need to watch a show, do that, if you need to be alone then do that. School will there whether you’re happy or not. Might as well make yourself happy to have a shot at doing the work. I’m not trying to reduce what you’re feeling but the environment here can be quite toxic and that’s not just the academics, if you know what I mean. Oh and when they say speak to someone, it doesn’t always have to be another person, could very much be God. I don’t know if you believe in Him or not, I still think He’ll listen and you may feel better about it. That’s my two cents but you always have a choice no matter what anyone says. Remember that  Hiii love! While giving up really is an option, I don't believe it is the best you can choose. Sometimes, just look back and consider how far you have come. You may not have found anything valuable along the way, but your journey in itself is value. You can create a gratitude journal where you write everything that ever goes well and makes you happy, and when you feel down, you go back and remember the good stuff. All the best!  Hey, it's me again. The person in the post. Things are only getting worse. I'm scared. Gotta start counting days. If anyone cares to help...we start from 50.  At least we'll have time to say silent goodbyes to the people who deserve that in the least. 

Not in my perfect shape,but I can still utter some wise words - If you ever find yourself in a situation that needs decision making and someone's life/future is concerned/involved,do it well. Do what you'd do if the person involved was of your lineage,or even you. 

That should help when you'll be joining the dots. Heyy,it will all be alright in the end. We are both grown. The rules don’t make sense to me. Engineering student and Business fi can’t date. Why will they change my business grades🤣🤣. some F-I dey want collect ma woman he figa he dey do am lowkey, just vim. honestly can’t support Ashesi’s decision to dismiss the FI over those relationships, because let’s be real ; emotions aren’t always something we can control. The deeper issue lies in the practice of bringing recent graduates back just a month after they leave to start teaching. These are people who still feel closely connected to the community, and sometimes those lines get blurry. Instead of creating healthier boundaries, it feels like we’re setting everyone up for trouble. Maybe it’s time to rethink the system, not just the individuals caught up in it. But love is blind🥹 But love is blind 🥹 I thought those were off limits since they're staff!!!!!!! Yohhhh this whole time I had a shot and I've been wasting it ....???? Time to get to work. It's just unfortunate cos these FI’s are hot ngl😌 As long as they're not your FI I don't see the problem because are you telling me that after being with my boyfriend from first year through to 3rd year, just because he's an FI now and I'm in final year (and still a student), we should break up? Eih!! Why the hel is this a question? 

It shouldn't happen I don’t see why they should be a problem unless, that particular FI teaches you, but then again an FI moving to you is the creepiest thing ever , you think they are being very  nice till “I love you “ 🤣🤣🤣 like lmaooooo??? that FI should be glad I didn’t report him whathehelly 🤣???  Ladies reduce the way you talk to males FIs. You're too attempting.
I am not saying there is any relationship though😂😂😂😂 If you're dating an FI as a student, please keep it HIDDEN, even if that FI isn't one for any of your classes. Best case, put it on hold till either one of you leaves the campus. You wouldn't want the situation where students find or take intimate images of you and the FI and twist the story as the FI taking advantage of you. It could be used to blackmail the FI. Worse, HR may find out and sack the FI.  It makes sense that we're asked not to date our FIs. It's not fair that people would study all night to get 60% and others would use bae to get 100. If you're in a relationship with someone and you become an FI, just don't be an FI for their course and it's fine.  Let’s forget FI matter first, please can’t these roommates know when to draw the line! It’s 12am and I need to sleep for my next class, why would you be disturbing everyone with your all night calls! This is so frustrating! Why don’t you just go and sleep on the car park so you can talk 1000hrs. So you’re dating so we shouldn’t sleep in peace??
 As an FI, if you say you can't resist because you were recently a student, shame on you. Grow up and manage your responsibilities. It's like saying you can't help but steal because the money is in front of you.  Student-FI relationships should be allowed!!! They are adults.Adults should be free to make their own choices. For a university that preaches inclusitivity and all,they should really be tolerant to this too.Not a big deal in my opinion. I have had sex with an FI. It was really good.  Munchies workers are so rude sometimes, mood swings all over, serving wrong food, not paying attention to details and being so nice to me but not to my neighbors. If you think you’re not in the mood to serve us, just pack your stuff and go home….. period!!! I’m sure there are are many ongoing but they just haven’t put a name on it. We see you getting too friendly. We see you🤭 Not related to the student -FI relationship but  the C’25 boys , they are the worst set ever .Especially those group of boys fuck them all "
