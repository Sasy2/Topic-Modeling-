Week 1,"Which female wants to get some? The school dey kill me o i’d give up all my men for you but you said you’re not ready for anything serious hm😔 Some squad deg toss early in the moring I am a sex addict (I have never had sex before). Charle the school hard. But i still go graduate That engineering department hm I have the biggest crush on that maisy girl in 26, heard she has a boyfriend abroad but that won’t stop me from getting her  I want the Nicole girl in 26, but she’s been reshing me and plenty other guys  School is too overwhelming and overloaded. Sometimes I feel like ending it all fr sometimes i feel like jumping from the hostel rooftop. i stood there for an hour before turning around and going to my room.  So the education issue I know nobody forced me but why is it so hard oh what a life fam, its annoying that some gates are locked around 11pm. What is the point? Why is Big Ben so stingy with their stew like come onnn More food places on this campus would help also a laundry service off campus would help because tell me why I am carrying my laundry all the way to school. I am not Kofi Kingston yk  Why is the gym closed at 9pm what if I want to do aesthetic boy and go and lift at 2 am How would people who want to play a sport but are shy of playing a sport go about playing a sport yk . Cause me I am a shy person","Which woman is interested in a relationship?  School is extremely difficult; I would give up all my romantic interests for you, but you said you are not ready for a serious relationship. Some of my friends leave very early in the morning. I am a sex addict (although I have never had sex before). Honestly, school is hard. But I will still graduate. That engineering department… I have a huge crush on Maisie in room 26. I heard she has a boyfriend abroad, but that will not stop me from pursuing her. I also want Nicole in room 26, but she has been rejecting me and many other guys. School is too overwhelming and overloaded. Sometimes I feel like ending my life; sometimes I feel like jumping from the hostel rooftop. I stood there for an hour before returning to my room.  I know nobody forced me into this education, but why is it so hard? Oh, what a life! It is annoying that some gates are locked at 11 pm. What is the point? Why is Big Ben so stingy with their stew?  More food places on campus would be helpful. A laundry service off campus would also be helpful because why am I carrying my laundry all the way to school? I am not Kofi Kingston, you know. Why is the gym closed at 9 pm? What if I want to work out and lift weights at 2 am? How can shy people who want to play sports actually participate in sports? Because I am a shy person."
Week 2,"That one guy Julias, he too smart! I also have a crush on him but he's short 💀😭 Didn't someone do this last time and it got shut down? i have this guy i’ve been talking to for a while, well not for a while, it’s been six months and he hasn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. idk why , it bothers me cause i feel like he’s hiding us . doesn’t post us i don’t think even his friends know that we’re together. what do i do?  Ashesi boys have 0 class and are so entitled and judgmental, it’s disgusting. All they do is kiss and tell and be proud of it. Sorry for generalizing, but it’s quite a number of them who do this. There’s no honor in kissing and telling and the people you’re telling to, have no respect for you as a person. They need to grow tf up, we’re not kids anymore.  Having swings was such a great idea  There isn't a space for hopeless romantics here  honestly speaking Ashesi boys enjoy kiss and tell and even add stuff that didn’t happen to the kiss and tell ei? so just can’t keep quiet? must you tell everybody? and you’re proud of it too, treating girls like trophies trying to bag all of them. that’s quiet nasty  Word of advice: do not date an Ashesi boy, protect your peace please🙏🙏. They will lie to you and make it look like you’re desperate.  26 girls are whoever they say they are. Their beauty is out of this world  that tall boy in C’25. thinking you can get away with the things you do lol Can they move Big Ben to Akonnor’s location and sack Akonnor Some Ashesi students are the most corrupt people I've ever met.The most shocking for me are those who parade as good people. SHAME! Chale why am I fighting for my life in a half credit course? #Leadership Be specific wai... bunch tall boys dey c'25. Make you no spoil wanna brand😹😹 Ashesi boys don’t be shy to approach we don’t bite…sometimes  Ashesi girls will show you pepper Beatrice c26 I really really appreciate your friendship 💖 i hope your hairline recedes till you grow bald, evil boy Somebody for humble munchies.

Those who know, know. How can I call munchies and in the middle of the order they’ll tell me “Call back I’m taking someone’s order” Ah then why did you pick the phone? If God did exist,
Then you would be mine,
You're in my prayers,
Every single night Maybe it's cause I forget faces easily, 
But I can swear I see a new ""most beautiful girl I've ever seen"" every week The current ASC should stay out of this elections Taking the right path sometimes makes you seem like a fool Why is this boy such a man-child? At your big age? Oh nooo NK and his group, C'26, are so mean to girls in public places. They think it's cool. It's time to grow up, assholes! Please post more responses🫠 Those guys who don't like scholars,what have we done err🥺🥺? At least talk to us. This school is too boring ah This school plenty funfoolers dey. We all dey complain say the course dey lash we but the person you dey complain plus he get 85% Those boys driving cars that will give you 1000 excuses instead of just being straight up when you ask for a ride go and chew your cars wai🙄 You guys should tell us what is on and off limits because what I want to say dier🤣 Ashesi Health center is such a JOKE Somebody for humble that Derrick guy for Dzidel’s. How can you hang up on me. Tsw The engineering department dey kill me hm Ashesi girls need to smile some more. Lots of you are unapproachable. We understand the school is hard but no be we do am please  I heard there’s a Stallion in C’24🫣😍","That Julius is very clever! I also have a crush on him, but he is short.  Someone did this before and it was shut down, right? I have been talking to this guy for six months, and he still hasn't asked me to be his girlfriend. I do not know why, and it bothers me because I feel like he is hiding our relationship. He does not post us on social media, and I do not think even his friends know we are together. What should I do?

Ashesi boys are incredibly entitled and judgmental; it is disgusting. They engage in gossip and are proud of it. I apologize for generalizing, but many of them behave this way. There is no honor in gossiping, and those you tell have no respect for you. They need to mature; we are not children anymore.  The swings were a great idea. This place is not for hopeless romantics. Honestly, Ashesi boys enjoy spreading rumors and even add things that did not happen. Why can they not keep quiet? Why must they tell everyone? And they are proud of it, treating girls like trophies and trying to date many of them. That is quite nasty.  My advice: do not date an Ashesi boy; protect your peace. They will lie to you and make you seem desperate.

Twenty-six girls are whoever they say they are. Their beauty is extraordinary. That tall boy in C'25 thinks he can get away with his actions. Can they relocate Big Ben to Akonnor's location and fire Akonnor? Some Ashesi students are the most corrupt people I have ever met. The most shocking are those who pretend to be good people. Shame! Why am I struggling in a half-credit course?  #Leadership Be specific. Many tall boys are in C'25. Do not ruin your reputation. Ashesi boys, do not be shy to approach us; we do not bite…sometimes. Ashesi girls will show you pepper. Beatrice in C'26, I truly appreciate your friendship. I hope your hairline recedes until you are bald, you evil boy! Someone should humble the munchies. Just because they are the only ones with waffles, they think they can treat us poorly. There is one guy in C'25 who lies every day. One day, that Leadership lecturer will find me waiting by his car with a bat. #I’lldoyoubeforeyoudome Shout out to all the girls with locs; you can have my school fees. My lady in C'26…you will be mine soon (she follows this Instagram page). The smoking will kill you; your lungs will be damaged. Jesus loves you all. New Masere boys, leave your room; we like you. I go to basketball games just for the boys. Munchies forget, Peckish Pen for the win. That short boy in C'25 is dating other people's girlfriends; he looks innocent, but he is the devil, I tell you! People are engaging in too much sex on this campus—even in the handicapped toilet and the backseat of cars! God is watching you all. How explicit can we get with these confessions? Hosanna Hostel…those who know, know. How can I call munchies, and in the middle of my order, they tell me to call back because they are taking someone else's order? Why did they pick up the phone then?

If God existed, then you would be mine. You are in my prayers every night. Maybe it is because I forget faces easily, but I swear I see a new ""most beautiful girl I have ever seen"" every week. The current ASC should stay out of this election. Taking the right path sometimes makes you seem like a fool. Why is this boy such a man-child at his age? Oh no! NK and his group in C'26 are so mean to girls in public places. They think it is cool. It is time to grow up, you jerks! Please post more responses. Those guys who do not like scholars, what have we done? At least talk to us. This school is too boring. This school has many fools. We all complain that the course is difficult, but the person you are complaining to has 85%. Those boys driving cars that will give you a thousand excuses instead of being straightforward when you ask for a ride should chew their cars. You guys should tell us what is and is not acceptable because what I want to say is…🤣 Ashesi Health Center is a joke. Someone should humble that Derrick guy in Dzidel's. How can you hang up on me? The engineering department is killing me. Ashesi girls need to smile more; many of you are unapproachable. We understand school is hard, but it is not our fault. I heard there is a handsome man in C'24."
Week 3,"Can’t wait for C’27 to join in January ,I heard they’re sooo fine. A lot of students vote for people without realizing it is a commitment to support whoever they vote into power. If a nation fails, it is on the faults not only of the leaders, but also of the people that didn't position themselves to run with the vision they voted for. As a matter of fact, many vote for people rather than visions. No wonder the blame game has many subscribers  Please, at least 2 posts a day🫠 I am very happy that this semester will soon end.
Bye Bye to FDE !!! Imagine o, we'd get rid of FDE very soon.... Honestly speaking, how do girls want us to approach them? To the girl who has been speaking to the guy for 6 months now, have you asked him the reason why he hasn’t asked you out? If not I really feel like you should. I think Ashesi girls could also meet us halfway. If you like a guy please let him know . Charley munchies too their new pack why? Them dey serve kids for children’s day? You tear 5 spoons nor the food fini… Ashesi isn't as stressful as students make it seem. Most people are just handling other significantly demanding things besides school or are simply disorganized and/or bad at managing their time and commitments Girl, regardless of the duration of your conversations, if he's creating doubt in your mind, remember the sister code: it's time to step away. So what is the point of locking the gates behind the new lobby and hostel 2C. Any thief can just jump over the wall. Fam, its annoying that some gates are locked around 11pm. What is the point? The one saying Ashesi isn’t stressful dierr I want whatever they’re having cause ei😂… What do you mean let the guy know you like him? If the guy likes you enough, he will approach you. There’s a certain room on the top floor of New Masere. Those two boys should know that the hostel walls are very thin wai😂we hear all the nasty things they say about people🤢 But ashesi boys do you smile? How can I meet you halfway🤣 Ashesi boy math: They ask if you are single but never shoot their shot🙄 The man at essentials too why just small thing he dey get angry or he don't know we are Dbees. You guys for talk to him ooo New masere boys, please line up outside, stop hiding in the room, I want to see something 😀 I’m looking for some guy in Dufie Annex
If you’re nice,please meet me at Hakuna 
11 am Saturday sharp👍🏾 Nana Yaw Ntim. I want you. Just because we vote for leaders doesn't mean we are not allowed to criticize or blame them. We are holding them accountable for the promises and dreams they sold us when they were rattling their manifestos.
 The fact that we have given someone power doesn’t mean we should follow them blindly and keep mute when they are not fulfilling their duties. Dear Ashesi Boys,
Not all of you are destined to have beards and that’s okay Repeat after me Ashesi boys: Braids are not for everyone!! I don't know what to say but hi guyss
 Some of us are shy, but we are fun when you get to know us. Don't hesitate to approach us guysss😘. Person canvas dey show four 90's and one 67🥲....and guess the 67....0.5 Leadership!!!!😪...why????? Beyond surface level interactions, about 50% of Ashesi Students are assholes! Ashesi girls should stop saying we don’t approach them. If we do, you’ll tell us you have meeting to go to. The new Perkish place has better waffles. Bye bye burnt waffles and wings for 35 cedis. Do Ashesi boys realize some girls are simply uninterested like please focus on your studies and leave us alone I love my friends so much! Ashesi really breeds some long lasting and meaningful sisterhoods and I’m so grateful🩷 Eiii boys beware ooo… they said don’t approach them. They’ll bite you. The hate is too much for so called ethical leaders. It's in the air, everywhere. It's just a degree. Please breathe and free your heart. Rapture is near yk!  Yo, since the Ashesi boys won their game against Academic City, we, the Sisters, have agreed to dish out free smiles all week. I am thinking right - munchies is the worst on Sundays - i can’t order food until after 4 pm and their on campus “franchise” doesn’t deliver off campus. Please don’t tell me to talk - it’s exercise. I beg yew  The ashesi girls don’t they have ceilings, we are waiting for the surround sound videos","I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of the Class of 2027 in January; I have heard they are very attractive. Many students vote for individuals without understanding the commitment involved in supporting whoever they elect. If a nation fails, it is the fault not only of its leaders but also of the people who did not position themselves to work towards the vision they voted for. In fact, many vote for people rather than for their visions. No wonder so many people engage in blame games. Please, at least two social media posts per day. I am very happy that this semester will soon end. Goodbye to Financial Derivatives and Econometrics! Imagine, we will be rid of FDE very soon. Honestly, how do girls want us to approach them? To the girl who has been talking to a guy for six months now, have you asked him why he has not asked you out? If not, I really think you should. I think Ashesi girls could also meet us halfway. If you like a guy, please let him know.  Why are Munchies' new packs so small? Are they serving children's portions for Children's Day? You use five spoons and the food is still not finished. Ashesi is not as stressful as students make it seem. Most people are simply juggling other demanding responsibilities besides school or are simply disorganized and/or bad at time management. Girl, regardless of how long you have been talking to him, if he is creating doubt in your mind, remember the sister code: it is time to step away. What is the point of locking the gates behind the new lobby and Hostel 2C? Any thief can simply jump over the wall. It is annoying that some gates are locked around 11 pm. What is the point? The person who says Ashesi is not stressful, I want whatever they are taking because it is unbelievable! What do you mean, let the guy know you like him? If the guy likes you enough, he will approach you. There is a certain room on the top floor of New Masere. Those two boys should know that the hostel walls are very thin; we hear all the unpleasant things they say about people. But Ashesi boys, do you smile? How can I meet you halfway? Ashesi boy mathematics: They ask if you are single but never make a move. The man at Essentials, why does he get angry over small things, or does he not know we are Ashesi students? You guys should talk to him. New Masere boys, please line up outside, stop hiding in your rooms, I want to see something. I am looking for a nice guy in Dufie Annex.

Week 4,"please ‘ink is back’ or so; if you no fit post gist, shun because what’s this “boys meet us halfway” and “girls smile” boie3  Anytime you see Tracy C'24, the cute one, give her 50 cedis and see me, I'd replenish it for you. 

~Secret Admirer~ If it’s been half a year and you guys are still in the “talking phase”, idk what to tell you sister 😄 Low key why are some Engineering not helping like that. You see student putting in so much and you give them 1 over 20 in quiz. They scornfully marks I'm assignment and labs, at the end they get an E . . . Like howwww ?????
 Grow up boys ! Stop kissing and telling !! Y’all are making Ashesi seem like high school ! Bro you’re not 16! Talk to God instead of man! There is a 24 girl, you always ignore me on campus, you don't even say hi, so please stop sliding in my dm my dear. Thk you Ashesi girls with wrinkled thighs and black  bleached asses, please stop wearing those small jeans around. I feel sick when I see them. love how 26 boys go all out and spend on their girls To the girl who said ashesi guys should focus on their studies and not to approach them, please we need you only for our stay in Ashesi not for life so please cope and be humble. Thank You Will the bus thing to Accra be implemented before the sem ends? Masa, even people who take parking tolls in kejetia and things is it not 5 cedis and 10 cedis. 300 dollars how?! tsw Triumphant entry koraa Jesus didn’t take anything, they should take their road omo, una dey suffer - parking fee dey sound like una e-levy (just my humble opinion 🤣) - sika mpe dede nti UT cabs dier cash out season o cause you dbees still won’t want to walk✋🏾😀 I never really understood the meaning behind those who drive to campus from off campus aside showing off. You are at Dufie but you have a car because you can't climb a hill? I mean, I get it's easier but are you 50? Be fr. I dunno, a lot of your are overreacting to the parking fee. Who pays to maintain the roads, bricks, asphalt, line demarcation etc.? That's the point of the parking fee. You enjoy a resource, pay to maintain it. If the school fees go toward it, then you're forcing people without cars to also maintain a resource only you enjoy. Pay up or walk. The car park thing is or in my opinion a policy to curb the number of cars on campus because some members of staff who drive do not even get a space to park but i am wondering - are the staff part of this new policy? 
3,569.67 cedis a semester for parking?
fuel b3si sei? Next sem dier Leg-xus nkoaaa o Basic economics, people who value a commodity more will pay higher to use it (independent rationing mechanism). If you can't pay the parking fee, park your car off campus and walk. Those who really need the parking space will pay. If you can't pay, walk to class. Other universities that offer parking space also enforce parking fees and stickers because someone needs to pay to be maintaining the facilities involved in parking. Do some research. The parking fee is necessary mmom because some of you are very inconsiderate. How will you come and park your car at the same spot from 8 am till midnight depriving other people of parking space? If Ashesi now introduces parking meters too you'll complain, but you're deliberately hogging up public space. Those of you that have also been parking in the disabled parking spots, and long periods at that too, why? Don't you understand the point of disabled parking? At least, now the parking fee will force a lot of you to reconsider your selfish ways. The person talking about showing off should spend a sem at Charlotte and see something... not an ashesi student but it’s ridiculous to make students pay *in dollars* to park on campus. say the reason is even for make the campus greener, ashesi students probably bring cars because there isn’t readily, trustworthy transportation from the ashesi team. considering the school fees they pay too, it’s wild that they’re still finding ways to take money from students 💀 I know we all say this but from the bottom of my heart I’m tired  The next year 3 semesters dier them for bring the grading down o Really dreading next year This parking issue is a reflection of Ashesi’s pure wickedness. First having to pay fees for the accelerated semester, now $150+ a day to park? Very inconsiderate of our parent’s money.","Please spread the word; if you cannot share gossip, refrain, because what is this ""boys meet us halfway"" and ""girls smile"" nonsense?  Anytime you see Tracy, the cute one in her 24s, give her 50 cedis and tell me, and I will reimburse you.

~Secret Admirer~ If it has been six months and you are still just talking, I do not know what to tell you, sister.  Honestly, why are some engineering students not helpful? You see students putting in so much effort, and you give them one out of twenty on a quiz. They scornfully mark assignments and labs, and at the end, they get an E. How? Grow up, boys! Stop gossiping! You are making Ashesi seem like high school! You are not sixteen! Talk to God instead of people! There is a girl in her 24s; you always ignore me on campus; you do not even say hello, so please stop sliding into my DMs, my dear. Thank you. Ashesi girls with wrinkled thighs and bleached buttocks, please stop wearing those small jeans. I feel sick when I see them. I love how boys in their mid-twenties go all out and spend on their girlfriends. To the girl who said Ashesi guys should focus on their studies and not approach them, please, we need you only for our time at Ashesi, not for life, so please be cooperative and humble. Thank you. Will the Accra bus service be implemented before the semester ends? Sir, even people who collect parking fees in Kejetia and other places charge only five or ten cedis. Three hundred dollars?  Wow! Even Jesus did not take anything upon his triumphant entry; they should take their road tolls. You are suffering—the parking fee sounds like your e-levy (just my humble opinion). Because of the high cost of money, UT cabs are cashing out because you people still will not walk. I never really understood the meaning behind those who drive to campus from off-campus aside from showing off. You are at Dufie, but you have a car because you cannot climb a hill? I mean, I understand it is easier, but are you fifty? Be frank. I do not know; many of you are overreacting to the parking fee. Who pays to maintain the roads, bricks, asphalt, and lane markings, etc.? That is the point of the parking fee. You enjoy a resource; pay to maintain it. If the school fees go toward it, then you are forcing people without cars to also maintain a resource only you enjoy. Pay up or walk. The car park issue is, in my opinion, a policy to curb the number of cars on campus because some staff members who drive do not even get a parking space, but I am wondering—are the staff part of this new policy?

3,569.67 cedis a semester for parking? Fuel is expensive! Next semester, it will be Lexus only!

Week 5,"If you can't get a proper and secure voting platform stick to Microsoft forms😒...@JEC ei but they typed oo🤣🤣 That 25 engineering student with the “ uk” accent. You are not who you think you are wai. You naa you know yourself and what you did. Tsw I think some Ashesi boys Dont actually know when they're crossing the line into sexual harrassement and should get educated in it. Like seriously. Understand that No means no. Pt 1: You a, you said you'd been studying me and you wanted to date. I said sure lets talk over a proper date. Sake of 1 munchies sharwama and 1 sandwich you had to buy, you waited for me to get back to my room and sent me a message that “ you don't think you're ready financially for this relationship “. I said vim, no problem. Pt 2: That was 1st year 1st Sem. 2nd year 2nd sem , you changed your number and came back to text me that “ you’re so sorry for “hurting” me and it haunts you every time you see me and you want to approach me blah blah blah.” I said it’s alright I’m not hurt or bothered, because tbh I don’t know you. You are the one that was “studying “ me . Pt 3: I said I’ve forgiven you no need to feel haunted. You said oh let's continue what we started I want to approach you . I said respectfully I’m not interested so no. You keep forcing, I keep saying no.  There norrr “ don’t you go to church, so you can’t forgive a brother?.” Ei! On top my own personal preference you’re harassing me and questioning my religious background? Please I know the children my mother gave birth to wai, you're not part. Ashesi boys please learn some manners SLE and ODIP  needs to talk to Ashesi boys about consent. You can't just touch a girl if she has not verbally expressed consent in participating in whatever action you want to do. If you can sign contract kraa sign. Before you get carried to AJC for rape or molestation. MUNCHIES PLEASE WORK ON YOUR KITCHEN END - FRONT  DESK END COMMUNICATION!!! How can I come and order food that's on your board you're telling me it's not available for 3 consecutive meals?? Even giving me tissue to clean the board for you. Ei. Yall started so well idk what is going on now. Some of you are either immune to this bipolar Berekuso weather or have never been given a ride and it shows🤭 The 'maintenence of resources' does not hold water because the roads are a public resource and even if no student brought a car, the school would still have to maintain the roads and all associated with it because it is in their best interest as staff and visitors will also use it.  Those who can pay will pay. Sure. However, don't you think it is unfair and somewhat unethical of Ashesi to price students out of parking when the crux of the issue appears to be the school's failure to factor students bringing cars oncampus into their campus design? The $300 parking fee is excessive and can only be a temporary measure until they provide students adequate parking spaces. Trust, more people than they expect will pay and that parking fee in the end will not solve the issue. Let's not pretend they do not have the resources to provide adequate parking. Besides, Ashesi needs more parking spaces if they plan on hosting big events with visitors. Oh but you’ve been staring at me since the start of the semester oo madam. Don’t be afraid to approach please, girls can approach boys too. every event you are looking for a bomber lmao Going around asking for votes is sad. Can you guys stop already.   It’s appalling how people start making generalisations after a bad encounter. Charley y’all should check your facts before you make generalisations waii😤😤 why wasn't Kb nominated in the first place ? Some Ubora Awards nominees were patched(illegally put there)  Why do Ashesi girls like to generalize Ashesi boys like that about things. If things were reversed it would be termed misogynistic or misogynistic adjacent. Most of them are mid and they see themselves too much I get that Ashesi is a school for extroverts and all but, people need to stop assuming every student is an extrovert, it's not easy for some of us. Our social battery dies really fast we beg relax for us😭. It takes time for us to come out of our comfort zone so please we beg bare with us and be take your time with us🤧🙏🏽 Engineering must be so easy because drafting an ASC mail, curating Havoc and mass brainwashing - All hands on Deck🤲🏿 Where free food dey, my vote you get💀 Aspirants doing a good job,don't know where from ASC tho😒 ASC and JEC got beef or what?🤨 Some coming with policies and others with promises  I think whoever it is who came up with the genius idea of sending an email to the student body that can influence people to think one candidate is a fraud should be relieved of their position - it was grossly out of line and unethical! So much for ethical leadership🙄 Someone should tell Salia to answer the question about the initial poster. If he doesn’t we won’t vote  The Whole campaign issues ( salia factor) is the fault of the vetting committee and JEC. This should have being addressed a long time ago Is Ashesi ethical ??. cause...","If you cannot secure a reliable voting platform, then stick to Microsoft Forms.  The Judicial Elections Committee's (JEC) typing errors are humorous. That twenty-five-year-old engineering student with the British accent is not who he thinks he is. He knows what he did. I believe some Ashesi University students do not understand when they are crossing the line into sexual harassment and need education on the subject.  Seriously, understand that ""no"" means ""no.""

Part 1: He said he had been observing me and wanted to date. I said, ""Sure, let's talk on a proper date.""  Because of one shawarma and one sandwich he bought, he waited until I returned to my room and texted that he was not financially ready for a relationship. I said, ""Okay, no problem.""

Part 2: That was first year, first semester. Second year, second semester, he changed his number and texted apologizing for hurting me, saying it haunts him every time he sees me, and that he wants to approach me. I said it's alright; I am not hurt or bothered because, to be honest, I do not know him. He was the one ""observing"" me.

Part 3: I said I have forgiven him; there is no need to feel haunted. He said, ""Oh, let's continue what we started; I want to approach you."" I respectfully said I am not interested. He kept pushing, and I kept saying no. Then he asked, ""Don't you go to church? So you cannot forgive a brother?""  He is harassing me and questioning my religious background because of my personal preference!  I know the children my mother bore; he is not one of them. Ashesi boys, please learn some manners. The Student Leadership Executive (SLE) and the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Progress (ODIP) need to address consent with Ashesi students. You cannot touch a girl without her verbal consent. If you can sign a contract, then sign one for consent. Otherwise, you might end up at the Accra Juvenile Court for rape or molestation.

Munchies, please improve your kitchen-front desk communication! How can I order food from your menu only to be told it's unavailable for three consecutive meals? I even had to clean the menu board for you with a tissue! You started so well; I don't know what is happening now. Some of you are either immune to the unpredictable Berekuso weather or have never been given a ride, and it shows.

The argument about ""maintenance of resources"" is weak because the roads are a public resource. Even if no student brought a car, the school would still maintain the roads because it benefits staff and visitors. Those who can afford parking will pay.  However, isn't it unfair and unethical of Ashesi to charge students exorbitant parking fees when the problem stems from the school's failure to plan for student cars? The $300 parking fee is excessive and can only be temporary until adequate parking is provided. More people than expected will pay, and the parking fee will not solve the problem. Ashesi has the resources to provide adequate parking, especially considering plans for large events.

You have been staring at me since the start of the semester.  Don't be afraid to approach; girls can approach boys too. At every event, you look for someone to criticize.  Going around asking for votes is pathetic. Please stop.

It is appalling how people generalize after a bad experience.  Please check your facts before making generalizations. Why wasn't KB nominated in the first place? Some Ubora Awards nominees were unfairly added. Why do Ashesi girls generalize about Ashesi boys like that? If the situation were reversed, it would be considered misogynistic.  Most of them are average and have inflated self-images. I understand Ashesi is a school for extroverts, but not every student is one.  Some of us have limited social energy; please be patient with us. It takes time for us to leave our comfort zones.

Engineering must be easy because drafting an ASC email, organizing Havoc, and engaging in mass persuasion are all so effortless. Where the free food is, that's where my vote goes.  The candidates are doing a good job, but I don't know where the Ashesi Students' Council (ASC) came from.  Do the ASC and JEC have a conflict? Some candidates present policies; others make promises. Whoever sent that email suggesting a candidate was a fraud should be removed from their position—it was unethical. So much for ethical leadership. Someone should tell Salia to answer the question about the initial poster; otherwise, we won't vote. The entire campaign's problems (Salia factor) are the vetting committee's fault. And JEC. This should have been addressed a long time ago. Is Ashesi ethical? Because..."

Peer review is challenging work. Peer review is crazy.
Tell me why someone is only now realizing in the class group chat that his teammates betrayed him. The engineering students are overly confident. Nobody forced you to choose a difficult course.  Nobody annoys me more than the Dean's List students who complain. Someone please rescue me from this difficult school. Someone should tell Gilbert from C'26 to stop pursuing other people's girlfriends and find his own. The Hi5 group is always generous with their food.  One day I waited for almost an hour."

 Some boy dema call syme take my babe. God see's all. 
Next semester I'll do cornrows like the boy so she'll run back.

So those of us who cant pass the papers this sem the grad we no go see top?🥲 Networks students, please we have a class at 6 p.m after DSD today, because what Bob Sowah wants to do to us deɛ, hmmmmmm😭😭 School is stressful? Let me tell you 3 bytes about it; hopefully you'll get :)

One step at a time 
Paying the currency of time 
More sour than lime
Disconcerting like brine 

There is an end that is mine
Through the path that I stand
There's no gain without a price
But sometimes I wonder if I can

I bear the pressure daily 
Like 10,000 feet beneath the sea
It appears I'm drowning 
Yet I still manage to see 
I still manage speak right from under the deep

It seems I've been there for many years 
But strangely experienced not death but only fear
Wondering if it were more than me yet finding no tears to grieve,
I looked around and noticed a sea of others living beneath this heavy sea strangely easily

Then I realized, I never really was under the sea
But in  simulation of the things that must be
No wonder I could breathe and still manage to speak
Though the water was thick and sometimes darker than ink

It sure seems tough for  a simulation but I guess it's worth it if I can breathe and live under any depth at the end of it Am I the only one failing FDE?? Because eii Engineering mechanics kwerh!!! I can’t do this for four years o The semester was very stressful and challenging. I can't believe I'm already studying into the night for exams eeiii level 100 wow Hmm if I start, I’ll vex waii so it’s okay. I’m just glad it’s over. Eihh. Odeishiii Everyone is playing with my gradessss!!!!
FDEEE eiii hm. I now understand, 'nipa no bi y3 cobra'. Nipa no bi y3 cobra ankasa.  Trust no one🤧 Chale I beg Eiii semester of struggles. In fact this semester has shown me shege
 Since the grades aren't grading anymore, I might as well start prepping to be oga wife😂😂 I don't know who needs to hear this, but whatever your grades may be, do not let it define your whole life. Your happiness is worth more than grades!🤗 A word to our all-knowing colleagues: Life is full of surprises. So learn to support others without making yourself feel too good.","My candidates for next year because this year was extremely difficult; I did not perform well.  Ariana G. for president, K.

Like 10,000 feet beneath the sea,
It appears I am drowning,
Yet I still manage to see,
I still manage to speak right from under the deep.

It seems I have been there for many years,
But strangely experienced not death but only fear,
Wondering if it were more than me yet finding no tears to grieve,
I looked around and noticed a sea of others living beneath this heavy sea strangely easily.

Then I realized, I never really was under the sea,
But in a simulation of the things that must be,
No wonder I could breathe and still manage to speak,
Though the water was thick and sometimes darker than ink.

It sure seems tough for a simulation, but I guess it is worth it if I can breathe and live under any depth at the end of it. Am I the only one failing FDE? Because Engineering mechanics is extremely difficult!! I cannot do this for four years. The semester was very stressful and challenging. I cannot believe I am already studying into the night for exams—level 100, wow! Hmm, if I start complaining, I will be very angry, so it is okay. I am just glad it is over. Everyone is playing with my grades!!! FDE, hmm. I now understand, ""a person is not a cobra."" A person is definitely not a cobra. Trust no one.  Friend, I beg you, this was a semester of struggles. In fact, this semester has shown me hardship. Since the grades are no longer being released, I might as well start preparing to be a rich man's wife. I do not know who needs to hear this, but whatever your grades may be, do not let them define your whole life. Your happiness is worth more than grades! A word to our all-knowing colleagues: Life is full of surprises. So learn to support others without making yourselves feel superior."

Mr Crush, don't be shy; come talk to me; I promise I don't bite. 😂😂 So last year's valentine's the ASC made something like what the ink is doing where people would anonymously fill a form and then wish their crushes, lovers, secret admirers a happy Valentine's some even confessed their feelings and these were later posted on ASC snapchat...it was a nice experience. How about you guys do something like that too but this time around make sure the forms go to the class group coz some people couldn't fill because they couldn't access the forms....please consider this..... i beg i can’t take it anymore. How do i tell my roommate she’s sooo noisy. She and her boyfriend can be on a call for 48 hours. 🧓🏿SOS - it’s enough pain to be on campus.😭 This semester dierrrr only God oo","We will share, but you will not share. Valentine's Day is fast approaching. Mr. Crush, do not be shy; come talk to me; I promise I do not bite. Last year, the Association of Students (ASC) created a system where people anonymously filled a form to wish their crushes, lovers, or secret admirers a happy Valentine's Day; some even confessed their feelings, and these were later posted on the ASC Snapchat. It was a nice experience. How about you all do something similar, but this time ensure the forms are sent to the class group because some people could not participate due to lack of access to the forms? Please consider this.

Week 15,"This Moss code checker is crazy Those saying Ashesi students didn't show up. Some students had three submissions due that night. How did you expect them to be there. Come on.  Those sending sublime messages for people to comeback to their lives, how are they supposed to know it’s them? There might be 50 other people in the same situation. No confusions here I beg. I am still hoping my crush will come talk to me... 
This crushing thing is not easy oh 🥲 Our love was like cold fire
Now it’s like drowning fish
She’s happy in another’s arms
And it burns my being hearing and seeing her happy with this other.

 I miss her, I really do. She’d see this and not know it’s me, but I miss her a lot.  The guy who said he misses her, just text her or she cut you off ? 1st February, and I'm seeing people surprising a girl with a gift. Let's wait for the 14th wai. The oppression is too much 😂😂 if we were a serious community Aunty Caro wouldn’t be getting any customers fr The events suck because people know that they will be/feel judged by others if they are outwardly ratchet. People want to GRIND, dress however they want, and be less sober without  being judged for it, otherwise its just a crusade. Womp womp! Ashesi has SOO many rules that it has bred a culture of pretenders. Ashesi students can party but once we come to this hill we have to PRETEND to be good little boys and girls. Good boys and girls are boring at parties.  The parties suck because ASHESI is a conservative highschool with pretenders. For all those saying the parties are boring or whatever,you can leave the school. You read the handbook so you knew what you were getting yourselves into. You can always leave the school to party. No one is stopping you Class of 2024 boys, please stop admiring 26' girls. We're rich, sexy and out of your league. Stay with your girlfriends we beg. Mwuah! The hill isn't safe. You speak up and the staff are waiting to kick you out. You laugh with people, but deep down they can't stand you. Read, work hard and leave.  So we are not going to talk about the queer people in Ashesi? Hmmmm. I'm just coming and I see them wai.  Tell me why I almost gave that short boy a chance?👀. I love tall men but the way he was so smooth with his words, I almost told him I didn’t have a boyfriend😅and he’s freaking smart too cause the way the banter was bantering guys…i’m a loyal girl though😊 How do I tell this foreign guy that I have a crush on him? Everytime we meet he always has airpods on😭 Should I just approach him or wait for the right time? Valentine is coming though….HELPPP😭  Found out today that his birthday is on Valentines…new ick unlocked. Men are not supposed to be born on valentines, thats selfish This new ASC is really good. Keep up the good work. People will start to turn up The school forgets the fact that once you deny people some things the people develop some sort of silent rebellion and all you’ll be doing is raising a bunch of hypocrites who outwardly portray fake love for the culture buh deep down…. I want to believe that those who were complaining about the school rules actually realise that it is a school. This is not some club to allow you to grind and do what you want. Besides you appended your own signature to the acceptance form so if you can't abide please a withdrawal letter is very simple to draft( RESPECTFULLY)  Don't be deceived by atmosphere, when you see men carry your things and runnnn💀😂 
It was dusk on my perfect day
In my world that knew only one queen
The clouds had killed my sun’s bright light
I couldn’t watch her leave, so my tears blurred my vision Highlanders is the SI unit for trash 🚮  Most people go off campus to be wayward. Stop lying about not having privacy. Just say you want sex. Stop breaking that girls back in New mas. The girl who said 2024 boys should focus on their gfs and not 2026 girls, I promise you, is not all of that. No male species has ever moved to her before, just an attention-seeker🤣🤣 ‘24 CS girls- you’re who you think you are okay? Beauty+brains+career-oriented… top tier women!  You said we should have sex I said no, I don't see you like that, now when you see me you behave like you don't know me. Foolish girl🙄 Never will I want to be in a room with Niger people ei❗️ The plan was to be focused but there is this 27' lady shifa I don’t even know if I’m getting a Val’s day gift from this guy and we’ve been “dating” for a year eii  ASC should share flowers for the singles so we don’t feel left out on the 14th😭🙏🏾 very random but can Academic City stop trying to be Ashesi so bad?!! Like we always ignore but this has conversation has to be had causee ughhh","This Morse code checker is frustrating.  Those claiming Ashesi students did not attend are wrong. Some students had three assignments due that night. How could you expect them to be present? Seriously. Those sending cryptic messages for people to return to their lives, how are they supposed to know it is them? There could be fifty other people in the same situation. There is no confusion here, I insist. I am still hoping my crush will speak to me...

This crushing is not easy. Our love was like a cold fire. Now it is like drowning fish. She is happy in another's arms, and it pains me to see and hear of her happiness with someone else.

I miss her, I truly do. She would see this and not know it is me, but I miss her very much. The guy who said he misses her, did he simply text her, or did she cut him off? It is February 1st, and I am seeing people surprising girls with gifts. Let us wait for Valentine's Day. The pressure is immense. If we were a serious community, Aunty Caro would not be getting any customers. The events are unpleasant because people fear judgment for being themselves. People want to dance freely, dress as they please, and relax without being judged, otherwise, it is just a charade.  Ashesi has so many rules that it has created a culture of pretense. Ashesi students can party, but once we are on campus, we must pretend to be well-behaved. Good boys and girls are boring at parties. The parties are unenjoyable because Ashesi is a conservative high school filled with pretenders. For those who find the parties boring, you can leave the school. You read the handbook, so you knew what to expect. You can always leave to party. No one is stopping you. Class of 2024 boys, please stop pursuing 2026 girls. We are wealthy, attractive, and beyond your reach. Please stay with your girlfriends. The campus is not safe. If you speak up, the staff are ready to expel you. You laugh with people, but deep down, they dislike you. Study hard and leave.

So, we are not going to discuss the LGBTQ+ students at Ashesi? I am just observing them. Why did I almost give that short boy a chance? I prefer tall men, but he was so charming with his words, I almost told him I did not have a boyfriend, and he is incredibly intelligent; the way our conversation flowed... I am loyal, though. How do I tell this foreign guy that I have a crush on him? Every time we meet, he has his AirPods in. Should I approach him or wait for the right moment? Valentine's Day is coming... HELP! I found out today that his birthday is on Valentine's Day... a new turn-off. Men should not be born on Valentine's Day; that's selfish. This new student council is truly excellent. Keep up the good work. People will start attending events. The school forgets that denying people things creates silent rebellion, and all you will be doing is raising a group of hypocrites who outwardly show fake love for the culture but deep down... I want to believe those complaining about the school rules understand that it is a school. This is not a club where you can do as you please. You signed the acceptance form, so if you cannot abide by the rules, a withdrawal letter is easy to write (respectfully). Do not be fooled by appearances; when you see men carrying your things and running... It was dusk on my perfect day, in my world that knew only one queen. The clouds had obscured my sun's light. I could not bear to watch her leave, so my tears blurred my vision. Highlanders is synonymous with trash. Most people leave campus to misbehave. Stop pretending you lack privacy. Just say you want sex. Stop mistreating that girl in New Mas. The girl who said 2024 boys should focus on their girlfriends and not 2026 girls is not all that. No man has ever pursued her; she is just seeking attention. Class of 2024 Computer Science girls—you are who you think you are. Beautiful, intelligent, and career-oriented—top-tier women! You said we should have sex, I said no, I do not see you that way, and now you act like you do not know me. Foolish girl. I never want to be in a room with Nigerians. The plan was to focus, but there is this 27-year-old woman... I do not even know if I am getting a Valentine's Day gift from this guy, and we have been ""dating"" for a year. The student council should provide flowers for single people so we do not feel left out on Valentine's Day.  Academic City, please stop trying so hard to be Ashesi! We usually ignore it, but this needs to be addressed."

We’re rather on the 2027.💆🏾‍♂️ Come correct for us to give you the attention you dearly crave.

Ah What's happening to the Hive
So many restrictions  originality is so cute, esp. on a campus with the major populace undergoing an identity crisis   The latest review needs to go through quality control. As it is just a hate piece and not worthy of being read.  I am trying to forget about you. But how can I? It hurts me so much.
How can I forget about what we could have been?

Honestly, I envy the campus security guards; they get far better sleep than I do.

1.  Those who called us pretenders have a valid point. The more you observe, the more you see the hypocrisy, not just among students but within the school itself.

2. Is it mandatory to be a leader, especially a service leader? I didn't sign up for this; I'm only here for the money.

3. So, if I don't know the right people, I won't be selected for committees and opportunities? Not all opportunities are like that, but some are truly unfair.

My friend has been without a girlfriend for four years. I am worried about him. That short, twenty-five-year-old gym-goer who uses skin lightening cream, please stop. Please, can Off-Campus Munchies return? Africana is difficult to pass; Ashesi, please have mercy on us. We are tired! I am seeing some people posting about or watching movies on a Thursday night; are we attending the same school? Is the course not benefiting you? Classes from 8:00 AM to 6:15 PM; this school will exhaust me. Last-minute studying is not easy. What exactly is this school? Why do I have assignments due all weekend when mid-semester exams are literally tomorrow?"
Week 19,"Tell me why it's midsem week and McNobert is casually sitting in the classroom watching movies and TV series  while we're here struggling to learn😭😭😭 Can someone explain to me how and why some students in C'27 can have time for Netflix on a Monday night during a mid-sem week?

It's gone!! hmm my heart 
This one de3 on God oo if we’re being honest, the rain that fell today was for the lecturers “You can’t be doing this in my car” Eiiiii😂😂😂 are we just going to ignore the ""you can't do this in my car"" or sup chale them for sack the obolo guy o before he brings Ashesi down with him","Tell me why, during mid-semester week, McNobert is calmly watching movies and television series in the classroom while we are struggling to study. Can someone explain how some students in C'27 can find time for Netflix on a Monday night during mid-semester week? Are they still dreaming? Because, honestly! Why do we have classes during mid-semester week?  @academicCommittee, please intervene so that no one asks me how the exam will go. How did it go for you? So far, so good. Economics is difficult. Please, I am someone's child. Launching the ASC week with a car convoy after mid-semester? How did my mid-semester exams go? They went as quickly as the accelerated semester. It is over! My heart! This, honestly, if we are being honest, the rain that fell today was for the lecturers. ""You can't be doing this in my car!"" Oh my goodness! Are we simply going to ignore the ""you can't do this in my car"" comment? Or should they fire that irresponsible person before he ruins Ashesi with him?"
Week 20,"Guys, I think I'm in love🤭🤭 this boy is acting like Pharoah and won’t let me go 😆 Weirdly i miss school. Like all the work and pressure I miss the guy with glasses and a red mac in my oop class  Got my heart broken. Just trying to heal now. don’t come into a females life, break her and leave. If you're broken FIX YOURSELF and stop messing up other females lives. There are so many good females out there that are getting hurt on a daily basis just because some selfish guy out there can't be mature enough to know that he isn't ready for a relationship.  <<<anyway my break is going great so far It’s going to be a long week without you, KKC my love 😖 I love Jesus I'd understand the ISA getting low funding but nothing at all?

The ISA isn't getting funded cause domestic students aren't involved? the paid services off and on campus should realize that, it is not about the money used in purchasing(food), it is about the service you give; how you treat us!

This boy is acting like a Pharaoh and will not let me go.  Strangely, I miss school. I even miss all the work and pressure. I miss the guy with glasses and a red Macintosh in my OOP class.

4/10 To ASC: would you please organize a masquerade ball? As usual, bananas of the school where not represented in music yesterday... anyways they are just bananas... who cares Even if ASC brought Drake, no one will come  Car convoy to launch crazy day🙏🙏
 Crazy day👀 There was a lack of engaging activities and not much that represented the theme of ""Island riddims"" or "" caught in 4k""  I want to fly, but my wings are clipped
I want to run, but my shoes are ripped
I want to walk, but my pace is slow
I want to crawl, but the thorns have grown

I want to be free, but as free as I am, I’m caged
I want to dance, but the music taste is sour
I want to laugh, but only jokes I tell are funny

I need my peace, but I lost it in another

Engineering students have midsem(s) this week No KKT at a car event 😳😳 the theme for the ASC week should have been “if you no dey vibe, you know dey inside” because if you did not join the fun, how you go fit enjoy this week! - 10 outta 10 minus naffin  This one de3 ebi “now” or “never” o Play variety of music not only amapiano...it's more of a west african thing the rest of us don't really have as much fun....dancehall is quite popular🌝 Ooooh noooo here we go again. Ashesi concert gonna be fire with only 2 people attending but still fire 🔥 🔥🔥 Dj fadda needs to notice me 🫣.Mepe wo wai 😍(An’26) An entire council sat to plan this, things happened but we enjoyed. So the critiquing you do is thumbs down unless you can pulling the planning and execution of an event. KERS! I went to sleep after the cables caught fire …. I love sleep … but that was the Biggest mistake of my life … Herh 🤧🥲 I don't think the whole 'No Crazy Zone' concept should exist tbh. It's just one day in the ENTIRE year that Ashesi students get to let loose like that without consequences. It's a relevant part of campus culture and I think it's something that lecturers can plan their course outline around if don't want their lessons disrupted. Just let the students have it, chale. What's one day going to do? I am not in the ASC,but anybody that will come here to trash the effort they put into making this event becuase of the challenges yesterday, is a fool.  Great work done to the ASC! And to our cute ASC president🤭, we see your efforts and I just want to say be proud of yourself!! The music was mid, amapiano every time, overplayed Ghanaian songs and the occasional afrobeats. Y’all need to up your party music game for real! Dancehall, Riddims, RnB, Pop, Rap, Hihop, Reggaeton etc. are they a joke to you??? 
My bathroom concerts are wayyy better than what you guys spend money on🌝
Pay me I give you my Playlist 😂😅 Freaky Friday was honestly the best day.

To be honest, although the Jamaican music was not there, the vibes were there once you get past the ""people are watching me"" mindset and start thinking ""I came to have fun."" Boring, not feeling it at all. The first day was fun. The Ashesi DJ (father) did his thing. I hope he sees this; I have a crush on him. Shout out to Nigeria! I am marrying someone from Burundi or Rwanda. I love the new government, but people, please come out. Crazy Day is the day I can truly be myself. Shout outs to Annabelle '27… consistently stylish this week.

ASC week is mediocre. Engineering students have mid-semester exams this week. No karaoke at a car event? The theme for ASC week should have been ""If you are not vibing, you are not inside,"" because if you did not join the fun, how could you enjoy this week?  Ten out of ten, minus nothing. This is a now-or-never situation. Play a variety of music, not only amapiano… it is more of a West African thing; the rest of us do not really have as much fun… dancehall is quite popular. Oh no, here we go again. The Ashesi concert is going to be amazing with only two people attending, but still amazing. DJ Fadda needs to notice me.  An entire council sat to plan this; things happened, but we enjoyed it. So the critique you are doing is a thumbs down unless you can handle the planning and execution of an event.

You can't get up and preach ethics and then punish rapists less than they deserve. Disgusting. Oh, right, because apparently, using someone else's meal plan is the ultimate crime worthy of expulsion, while, you know, sexual assault and social misconduct only get you a slap on the wrist with a few semesters of suspension.

I'll drop all the names of girl if I have to. Just get justice. It’s during Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month too that a sexual misconduct case gets that kind of a decision. Vim wai.  A place that talks about the honor code but someone who sexually assaults another only gets suspended🙄🙄 #makeitmakesense can you people like shut up?
it’s an academic institution not a social institution 
of course cheating is going to get a serious punishment ffs
it can really happen to anyone tsw I made it through another semester Hurray 🥳🥳🥳🥳.It was not  easy ,l almost gave up but God gave me strength🙏🙏.

Gideon Colombiana C'25, you are cute. Amaliah (2027), I have a huge crush on you; you are so pretty, but I am too shy to talk to you. Next semester, I will be brave. I think you are cute, but you have an avoidant attachment style. I know you (2027) and your boyfriend recently broke up… I am here for emotional and physical support. I like a girl in C'26, but she is taken, so I will wait. Someone should confess their love for me. I love Nathanael (the dark one) from C'27. Joanna C'27, I love you! Senanu C'26, next year you will be mine; last semester I was too shy. Shoutout to those AJC cases. Good entertainment. So proud of you, Salma C'27! Alvin C'25, you are the man! Salma gives the best hugs. Salma C'27, I am sorry. Please talk to me.  Elikem, why did you cut your hair?!"

Thank you, I couldn’t have done Pre-calc without you.  This course registration on CAMU is pissing me off. Been locked down at home for 3 days of my vacation.

It has been God throughout😊 The scripture that says ""By my God I leap over a wall"". Indeed, by my God I leap over these assignments and quizzes cors ei🫠 It’s a shame how Ashesi is all for “inclusivity” with all the women empowerment and opportunity emails, yet I didn’t see a single email on Men’s mental health month, June  “a little birdie been tweeting about Empower Her’s second bridgerton👀” Why will you decide to come and sit directly under the AC in a class that has countless empty seats and then you increase the temperature of the AC because YOU are feeling cold?? MY FRIEND??? She calls me daddy
Happy fathers day to me  Niggas who wear hoodies to a classroom but still turn up the AC. You deserve to burn in hell. ","How can we prioritize our mental well-being when we experience extreme mental pressure from this school? We simply pray, exercise, and relax. Affirmations are very helpful to me.

I watch my favorite show (Girlfriends…it is really good) when I am stressed. I secretly miss the support system at Ashesi. I honestly do not know how people survive this school without divine intervention! It has been God all along. The scripture that says, ""By my God I leap over a wall,"" is true. Indeed, by God's grace, I overcome these assignments and quizzes. It is disappointing that Ashesi emphasizes “inclusivity” with all the women's empowerment and opportunity emails, yet I did not see a single email about Men's Mental Health Month in June.  I heard that Empower Her's second Bridgerton event is happening. Why would someone choose to sit directly under the air conditioner in a classroom with many empty seats and then increase the air conditioning temperature because THEY are cold? My friend?

The happiest I’ve been in a while🥹 Hm it is well o, God will see us through in this Ashesi The English version:
Aaaarrrrhhh
Libido's trapped me again.
Tight top, big boobs
Horniness is calling me to her
And I feel like obeying
But that's silly and impossible
Silly because 
Libido's a drunk fool 
That breaks the neck 
Of rational prudence,
And impossible because
Even if I want
I can't get:
Shyness dries up my fuel of courage
No girl probably wants 
Me to enter their tunnel
And that's great
Cos libido and sex are drunken fools!
But
But
Le plaisir erotique* 
Sa motivation puissante* 
L'éspèrance de la grande joie* 
Nothing as engaging as it
This tug of war
Bewteen prudence and overflowing pleasure
Will only end when
I grow into Pope Francis' weathered body
Unfortunately.
Oi I see another girl with
Tits as big as a cow's own
The tug of war resumes
Oh here I go again

The French version:
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Le libido, il m'a piègé encore.
Chemise petite, des grandes seins
Le dèsir erotique m'appelle à elle
Et je suis incliné de l'obèir
Mais c'est bête et impossible
Bête parce que
Le libido, c'est un bête ivre
Ce qui casse le cou 
De la prudence rationelle,
Et impossible car
Même si je veux
Je peux pas obtenir :
La timidité séche mon essence du courage
Aucun fille me veut probablement
D'entrer son tunnel
Et c'est super
Car le libido et la sexe sont bêtes ivres !
Mais
Mais
Erotic pleasure*
Its powerful motivation*
Hope of great joy*
Rien aussi engagante que ça
Ce tir à la corde
Entre la prudence et la plaisir surécoulant
Terminera seulement quand
Je grandirai au corps patiné de Pape Francis
Malheureusement.
Hein je vis une autre fille avec des
Seins aussi grandes que ceux d'une vache
Le tir à la corde continue
Ah allons-y encore

* - the marked line must be italicised
 your friends could actually ditch you because they have found the love of their life, sucks These emails about the gym, at this rate they will start informing us about who just entered and left the gym. I just want to go home please.  In fact I just want to finish this school Ah so the people in relationships do they know that they are cheating on them 🤣🤚🏾 Ashesi boys will kill me lmao 🤣  What is the highest elevation on campus? We were once very close friends, he came around and now everything is messed up with her. SUCH IS LIFE My boy is even too busy to hang out,me sef I’m too busy 😔✋🏾 I have midsem tomorrow buhhh the amount of breaks I’m having is way more than my total revision period! Can I just get the degree now, (like in honor of my perseverance😭) Midsem sha! The only thing that has managed to take my mind off that guy! By the time I finish writing my papers, the crush will have vanished😭 Hmm ,bare minimum kraa enfa ooo So why would go to study areas like the library and databank 218 to make noise when it is meant for quiet studies??!!!!!!!! zero pressure, but the fact that I have zero pressure means my calculations are wrong since SLE is talking about CONSENT, let me just say it is not the case that if i’m wearing grey sweats, then proudly look (or touch)🙂 Shutouts to Akosua and Aseye!!! Idk how else 'we' could have survived Leadership II and Principles of Economics without you.  stressful week but i saw my crush today and suddenly life is worth living again  Chale I begggg😔 What happened to Ashesi D:Lab, please? I miss Hackathons 😥😥 honestly we need the opposite of caught being good for some people. some caught being bad...cause it's not even funny You guys should actually watch some of the 27s play Futsal, pure entertainment and talent What are these noises always from rooms in New Mas? Some of these caretakers in the off campus hostels should actually watch themselves  This FI Michael for Calculus is so proper  Isn't that smell in Akornor annoying? Big Ben Jollof actually goes too hard It’s interesting how Ashesi boys think it is so chill and nice to tell girls to smile I just need one very long hug.  That Big Ben Jollof person is lying😭 This academic weapon is going blunt😔 What kind of bipolar weather is this? Room inspections? Are we in Senior High School? Why am I just hearing Bend it Bend it from the first floor of New Hosanna? Running in the rain while holding an umbrella is crazy. Have you no steeze? Ashesi 2025 boys why? Like why?? Have you not done enough??🤧 Something was bothering me. Then I took a nap and now I can't remember. 
Naps>>> These dogs that roam on the road to the hostel late at night, they are so SCARY I’m glad we did not work out. Goodluck to them you’ll look for me in every girl and you won’t find me 27 boys are attractive 😍  Chale Dufie ants are too many ,th⁉️⁉️ Why are the women at Big Ben so moody?  I know we all wanna be academic weapons this semester but please and please again, don't attach your self-worth to your grades. Trust me, you really don't want to learn this the hard way 🥲. A 'D' doesn't mean your life has ended. Strive for good grades but don't let it define how you think about yourself. The division in this school is so clear, but they make it look like we’re all equal. ( I hope you post this😭😭). I can’t count the number of times I’ve been made so uncomfortable.  The way some people have been treating me, I can’t wait to go home and block them all😂! It’s okay, I’ll take your crap for now because this is not my country anyway! Every day, I can’t believe you guys are the adults in this country, let alone this school!!  I dislike the way Big ben is nonchalant.  Seems like the owners might be millionaires  Contrary to popular belief, people don’t mind their business. Is it your life? Mind your business, please😒 Please stop taking videos of people taking free food. We won't come again ah😭 Everyone is in a relationship eiii😂 Most of you guys are engaged in pseudo productivity. What is it that you’re reading up to 3 am, then you sleep the entire day in class🚮 Exams are stupid, there are better ways of testing students knowledge  I’m scared It seems like our Ashesi boys just wanna tap that, nothing much nothing less, must be nice. Hope is all I had, it was snatched and destroyed. I’ve got nothing now but the tears that blur my vision of her. Big Ben’s new shito… is better than Akornor’s 🏃‍➡️🏃‍➡️🏃‍➡️ No because, why are you - a fresher - leaving your heart in the hands of a C’25 boy. Do we need to tell you??? I don’t know why people think when you approach them you want to date them lol, as for the division it’s everywhere, not just this school  Heavy on the ‘being made uncomfortable’.
Because we all know in our hearts that it won’t last. Tell me why you’re playing with my mental health in my own room🙄
You two should just get a room. So you didn’t know he was following you to your room🙄
He magically appeared and bit your neck? Berekuso Dracula. Serial entrepreneur. Jumping Jack. I’ll end it here  Nothing is ever that serious. Except for the liberal arts courses. Don’t joke with them 🚶‍➡️ Is the accelerated year even legal cause they working us like slaves  Those asking for hugs and things should relax,  you're probably the most hostile and unapproachable people and you want love You this girl in old mas,I miss you let’s get back together chale the streets are not for us ","It seems something always goes wrong at the gym!  I am so tired of those emails. This accelerated semester has taken a toll on me; I am not exaggerating. I used to be so much happier.  Why can't I stop thinking about this boy? I cannot even concentrate on my studies. He makes me incredibly happy, the happiest I have been in a long time.  Well, God will see us through this Ashesi experience.

Aaaaaaargh!
My libido has trapped me again.
Tight shirt, large breasts—
Desire is calling to me,
and I feel like giving in.
But that is foolish and impossible.
Foolish because
libido is a drunken fool
that breaks the neck
of rational prudence,
and impossible because
even if I want to,
I cannot:
Shyness dries up my courage.
No girl probably wants
me to enter their ""tunnel.""
And that is fine,
because libido and sex are drunken fools!
But
But
*Erotic pleasure,*
*its powerful motivation,*
*the hope of great joy*—
nothing is as compelling.
This tug-of-war
between prudence and overwhelming pleasure
will only end when
I grow into Pope Francis's aged body,
unfortunately.
Oh, I see another girl with
breasts as large as a cow's!
The tug-of-war resumes.
Oh, here we go again.


My friends might abandon me because they have found the love of their lives; that's a shame. At this rate, the gym emails will start informing us about who just entered and left. I just want to go home. In fact, I just want to finish school.  Do people in relationships even realize they are cheating? Ashesi boys will be the death of me! What is the highest point on campus? We were once very close, but he came along, and now everything is messed up with her. That's life. My boyfriend is too busy to hang out; I am too busy as well. I have a mid-semester exam tomorrow, but I am taking way more breaks than I am studying! Can I just get the degree now, in recognition of my perseverance? This mid-semester exam is the only thing that has distracted me from that guy! By the time I finish my papers, my crush will probably be gone.  I need to do the bare minimum. Why would people go to quiet study areas like the library and Databank 218 to make noise?!  There is zero pressure, but that means my calculations are wrong, because Sexual and Life Education is talking about consent. Let me just say, if I am wearing grey sweatpants, do not stare or touch. Shout-outs to Akosua and Aseye! I don't know how we would have survived Leadership II and Principles of Economics without you.  This has been a stressful week, but I saw my crush today, and suddenly life is worth living again. Please help me! What happened to Ashesi D:Lab? I miss hackathons! Honestly, some people need to be ""caught being bad"" rather than always ""caught being good""—it is not funny. You should watch some of the Class of 2027 students play futsal; it's pure entertainment and talent. What are those noises always coming from the rooms in New Mas? Some caretakers in off-campus hostels need to watch themselves. This Michael, who teaches Calculus, is very good.  Isn't that smell in Akornor annoying? Big Ben Jollof is amazing! It's interesting how Ashesi boys think it's okay to tell girls to smile. I need a long hug. That Big Ben Jollof person is lying! My academic drive is waning. What kind of bipolar weather is this? Room inspections? Are we in senior high school? Why am I just hearing ""Bend it like Beckham"" from the first floor of New Hosanna? Running in the rain while holding an umbrella is ridiculous.  No style! Ashesi 2025 boys, why? Have you not done enough? Something was bothering me. Then I took a nap and can't remember it now. Naps are the best. Those dogs that roam the road to the hostel late at night are so scary. I am glad we did not work out. Good luck to him; he will look for me in every girl and won't find me. Class of 2027 boys are attractive!  There are too many Dufie ants! Why are the women at Big Ben so moody? I know we all want to be academically successful. I am facing academic challenges this semester, but I implore you, do not tie your self-worth to your grades.  Believe me, you do not want to learn this the hard way. A 'D' grade does not mean your life is over.  Aim for good grades, but do not let them define your self-perception. The social divisions in this school are very apparent, yet they try to present a façade of equality. (I hope you post this.) I have lost count of the number of times I have felt deeply uncomfortable.  The way some people have treated me has made me eager to return home and block them all! It is fine; I will endure their unpleasant behavior for now because this is not my home country. I am constantly amazed that you people are considered adults, let alone students in this institution! I dislike Big Ben's nonchalant attitude. It seems the owners might be millionaires. Contrary to popular belief, people do not mind their own business. Is it your life? Mind your own business, please. Please stop recording videos of people taking free food. We will not attend again. Everyone is in a relationship! Most of you engage in pseudo-productivity. What are you reading until 3 a.m., only to sleep through class? Exams are pointless; there are better ways to assess students' knowledge. I am scared. It seems like the Ashesi boys are only interested in casual relationships. Hope was all I had; it was stolen and destroyed. Now, all I have are tears blurring my vision of her. Big Ben's new shito is better than Akornor's. Why is a freshman leaving their heart in the hands of a second-year student? Do we need to explain this? I do not understand why people assume you want to date them when you approach them. As for the social divisions, they exist everywhere, not just in this school.  The feeling of being made uncomfortable is overwhelming. Because we all know deep down that it will not last. Why are you playing with my mental health in my own room? You two should get a room. So, you did not know he was following you to your room? He magically appeared and bit your neck? Berekuso Dracula. Serial entrepreneur. Jumping Jack. I will stop here. Nothing is ever that serious. Except for the liberal arts courses. Do not underestimate them. Is the accelerated year even legal because they are working us like slaves? Those asking for hugs and affection should relax; you are probably the most hostile and unapproachable people, yet you desire love.  Girlfriend from Old Mas, I miss you; let's get back together, friend; the streets are not for us."
Week 36,"This capstone wants to cap me in stone but I serve a living God.🙏🏾 I have a crush on this girl, like I really like her .... I don't think I am good enough... ei  Her name is Sally btw I have the most supportive friends. Shoutout to Tani!!!! Shout out to the Intro to AI folks fr
We made it this far
We'd finish the course 
Hang on It's funny how some of you want to be treated like adults but act like kids...smh😒 Big shout outs to the support center
Those boys are the real ones The '27 girls are very much underrated. Argue with your screens ..the division is indeed everywhere, but why will you use the wealth of your parents to make people feel bad when we are having healthy conversations? No one is being bitter here but that’s the truth and the disrespect, let’s not even talk about it( I see how most of them make the international students feel unwelcome and they laugh at them). Please post this.. We need a C’25 boys recovery support group The hierarchy of wickedness in the school is from 25 then 26 then 24 boys . The 27 boys will become wicked when the 28 girls arrive You’ have done yourselves married couple in new mas when ecast, it go bloody Stop using your bare hands to shift people's laundry on the line. Have you no dignity? Put that high school culture behind you ffs. You still look down on people? 2024? Oh bossu To those people that borrow chargers and power banks and don’t return it, God is watching you. Grades really matter please 😭😭😭You still have time to do better 
An advice from me😌 Stop laughing in groups as girls when some boys you don't 'see' pass by, it's disgusting  Shoutout to Aisha from Akornor, she's proper for real So today is when you have realised the wickedness of 25 boys ,y'all will learn the hard way , wai 💀😤😢 It serves any 27 girl right if she's done dirty by a senior Some of you smell too bad, what's the meaning of this? It's a particular demographic I won't mention  Obiaa shirt brand ad3n? Amapiano is dead and I love it Sports really keeps some of us sane in this school  Must you always dress for attention? Shout-out to McNobert C'26
He really helped a lot of us with our Intro to AI assignment 
If not for him, the Zero would be waiting for some of us 😂😂

We love you bro 🫶🏾 Never trust a Ghanaian woman who swims. Eii mechanics!!!! Do they seriously think the code for passport events won't be shared?💀 Grading on a curve is utter nonsense   Can you be more specific, some of the C’25 boys are innocent 2025 boys slander??? I’ll be there!!! Demons fr Let’s not forget C’26 girls. Very evil  Those circle of boys in 25………🚩🚩🚩🚩run  girls run!  These ridesharing company drivers cannot stop complaining about the berekuso road 🙄 Dufie ants are plenty oo why?⁉️ Need a 26 girl like Maisy to save my life 😔 Please C’25 boys haven’t done anything you people should rest  C’26 girls. Hmmmm very wicked  The C’25 boys only the on campus ones are wicked. The rest are good Some of you people 25 boys haven’t done you anything you just want to feel among That light skin boy with glasses in 25 on campus who likes reporting boys to their gfs. Why are you jobless ? Wahala for 25 boys o🤣 25 boys we need you to come and remove your mouth immediately 😭 Idk how i’ll survive the rest of my stay in this school when my crush graduates this year (He doesn’t know I exist😔) Ah so is everyone fornicating on this mountain? The 25’ slander is too much😭😭(except for the dj and his squad, they deserve that shit) Zero rizz. I just follow you on Instagram and leave the rest to God hmm Please why are the girls crushing on ‘25 guys?? The ‘25 girls don’t even do that. Ewww Nana 26 is so fineee😍😍😍 The C'26 girls are heavenly stunning especially A**** Some of you talking bad about 25s on your stories do not know any 25 boys, I'm certain of this. Shout out to Hannah🤣🤣
love her fr🫶 Can't wait for FDE to be over!
Literally get upset every Tuesdays and Thursdays 😔 Idk why you people are on 25 boys (because let’s face it, it’s only a select group of them that are wicked) when the real demons are in 24. Very wicked bunch. Every single one of them🫵🏾 The ‘25 boys are actually way better ngl. It’s the ‘24 boys .Very wicked and inconsiderate. Thank God they are leaving  . bye hillside boys , you will not be missed  Belinda 26, is so cute and friendly when you get to know her. I love her IG though ❤️😘. Wait till I tell your main girl what you be doing that boy in C’25 Why are people concerned about things that do not matter? I think everyone needs to grow up for real. Most ladies on campus, even guys aren't mentally mature for relationships. Moreover, I think it's damaging when all we think of relationship is romance (for guys) and class (for ladies). Any relationship should be intentional and defined, else it's for playing fr. Anyways, we all know what we're doing!!  lol that one friend group in 25. Only proceed with them if you hate yourself  nothing to say about the other classes, let’s focus on the problem. But you guys should’ve done a banner to warn the girls earlier about c25. Rn dier it’s late they are already dating them. Shout out to all the unfortunate souls dating these boys Cook them! Cook them! They deserve it. Especially those people The person defending 25 boys , you yourself you’re a problem and your mistakes will choke you in a sea of regret sia There’s this 26 girl who left me for a 25 guy very early in my first year too. Life has never been the same Hierarchy of wickedness and the 24 boys are last?? Who do you think taught the 25’s and 26’s what they know The person saying the dj and his squad why don’t you say it to our faces? Please the dj doesn’t have any squad o Why are you people now using anonymous to voice out. Are you scared of 25 boys? “Even 25 girls don’t do that” but the whole school you them no dey rate Funny how everyone is saying “25 boys” but we all know the exact boys in that year😂 makes sense how one of them is the entercom chairperson “DJ and his squad” man you people should shut up  If one of you can step forward and boldly say a 25 boy has done you something do it. follow backs like yourself By the way is the Dj single…?trying to shoot my shot(even though they are saying he and his squad are scary) “Wait till I tell your main girl” 😭😭fruity guy aren’t you shy. Let me catch you My Boss Richard🙌🙌🙌 Dating in this school is hard cos everyone is literally in your business ughhh  4th grade you would be soooo disappointed that you're currently doing pre-marital things unpopular take: i reread old messages to make sure i don’t miss anything  The same way you enjoyed the relationship quietly with the 25 boys no, whatever that has happened, go through quietly na mongyae nkwaseadede no 😒. The way The Ink admin is unnecessarily selective of the kind of things posted here should be studied. Their filtration system is weird. You post slanders but you abandon opinions and real pleas. Or are you triggered by some of the facts? If you like, don't post this too. Truth remains truth boo <3 I don't know what the school can do to actually bring everyone together and for us to be a solid community. No matter what the school tries, it just doesn't work. Very segmented. the person who spoke about the ink's selectiveness is soooo damn righttt😭😭
cos tell me why I'll post my mind on the same subject twice, and you'll overlook it?? I be having the worst of days, but then I look up and remember that at least I didn't bite someone's neck and get suspended for 4 semesters ASC, pyjama day? And oh for the division, most int'l students don't really care because there's life beyond their small retard**d brain who think we don't have ambitions. Lol, the most ambitious students are int'l - they can't compete or relate  Stop using daddy's wealth to look down on people. Get a jobbb Why do schools make it such that students are forced to walk through the rain and get sick for boring classes??? Ink Admin reveal?🌝🫣 I read something about your interview with Maame Mensa-Bonsu and learned something thoughtful. But what's the essence of canceling the Dean's list when there will be no clear difference to show how others excel and how others are encouraged to excel merely by seeing other people's names on the Dean's list. ###BringbacktheDean’sList Such a haste decision to cancel the Dean's list. I love how my friend and I can talk about the Bible for hours and it never gets old (hint for them: ES Playlist❤️)  Too tough to be sentimental but Belinda and Bernice c’25, love you guys so so much Merhn.  Bring back Dean's list. Can we all stop pretending thay it is not normal for there to be segregation??? Ah
Let's be nice and cordial with each other but there would always be some divide so stop making it sound abnormal. Just do your part and be nice to everyone and accept that we cannot all act like one big family please. Shortest boy in the school Sedem, he is funny af. Good vibes in general 🫶🏽 Most Ashesi girls are not that pretty as they think are tbh, but they are very arrogant. Most carry the riches of their parents in their heads and think it determines their beauty. Lol  If the school fees you pay, your personal GPA, and your desire to further your education in grad school does not push you to excel them forget about Dean's list broda Bragging rights were never the main goal but being on the dean's list provided a great deal  validation to those who put the work in to excel. You can't judge a person for wanting to be recognized for succeding. Unless some other form of public recognition or reward will be put in place, bring the dean's list back. My best friend is the most supportive and the most down to earth person ever. I’m so happy she’s in my life, I love and miss her so muchh🥹❤️ I love the Ashesi students who still make efforts to talk to and befriend the introverts in the community. We’re not mean, we’re just reserved, please bear with us😭🙏🏾 Ohh so you people won't shoot your shots at your rushed by name again??? I’m grateful for the non Ghanaians in the community who are very expressive, I get to learn from your culture so that’s cool🤭 I love and am grateful for all my uni friends, especially the ones I made in my first year, wouldn’t have survived without them. Their the best❤️ I love that she loves chicken wings - 14643 So, without this dean's list, how would we know the smart one when we need help? I love how she suck my balls Lady Marge…just love her. High social and emotional intelligence ❤️ In every society there is segregation. Let’s accept that and live with each other in peace. We know we are a big family ( Ashesi family of course) but when it comes to individual relationships we are the same people who look at each other and define our own boundaries. When you approach anyone there is no way they are going to decide whether to socialize with you or not based on their “social status”. Just avoid defining your boundaries and expand your network on campus. It’s that simple. Cheers  I just love how my girlfriend knows exactly what to say to me in every situation. And she soooooo fine obviously. Top 3 girls on the planet fr. Imaginary or not, she has my heart ❤️  I love that he cares about me deeply. He is bad at communicating but puts alot of effort into talking to me. He smells great! Has a beautiful and generous heart. He's non-conventional too and I like that about him. Ashesi may have many annoying humans but there is a few like him, who remind you to be thankful.  Masa, if you’re on the dean’s list you know you’re on it. No one wants to know. Keep it to yourself! Happy birthday Anamalia, ilusm. (Please post this for me today, it'd mean so much to me) For the person saying the school is segmented, the big question you should be asking is who caused it? For a fact, Ashesi students complain a lot but I think the administration is part of the problem. Everybody is a hypocrite and living a lie!!!!! 

You can literally feel it Cancelling the Dean's list is necessary imo. You can get your motivation elsewhere. Moreover, you never know who your true friends are. Imagine being the only one there amongst your friends yet you do stuff together. The world is getting riskier baby Reality check is realizing that no one cares about your GPA if you're going for industry stuff. A sad situation is realizing a few of the 4.0 geez get good jobs but a higher percentage of 3.5s below get better/great jobs will clear your doubt. Do well, and let your motivation come intrinsically.  For the person waiting for motivation from Dean's list, sorry. Your motivation should not be from others. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself doing unnecessary comparison. And as they say, comparison is the stealer of joy Shoutout myself for playing both sides to always win This capstone... only God ooo. Abi if I get some C/D+ ago still graduate or??  They’re not taking your grade away, if you need deans list for motivation I suggest you re-evaluate your purpose here lol Are they completely cancelling the deans list or are they just not posting it on the wall anymore? I think some recognition is definitely due but no posting on the wall please I would recommend a personal email be sent out to whoever makes the deans list. It keeps the recognition without making it a public show off. Whether you decide to tell other people or not that’s up to you. can we do a lost and found for wangaari laundry? they sometimes mix up people’s clothes. really essential pieces too To the person who has an unconventional guy, please what's the year group. Seems like we'll share. Gems are rare to find Ah. Ewurade. For legal and ethical reasons i will unfortunately never be able to fully express how grateful I am for ChatGPT. I am slowly losing my ability to reason and analyze, but im truly grateful  Nothing scares me more than the fact that the girls know that the ajc will be on thier side if it is against a boy and they know they have this secret weapon even if it is not warranted, like using it to punish you for something else under the guise of harassment  New update: ask her to record an audio of her giving consent to have sex with her with the date and time and everything. If she says no, my nigga run, run like your mom's life depends on it. Amapiano dead???Wait for an event 🙂 The cat is not fat - it’s pregnant! Happy Birthday to the amazing Pfungwa! Can't this boy just ask me out? So you people won't mention your crushes by name? Are you people now shy???
 I've heard a lot of complaints about Ashesi guys, blah blah blah. But as a guy myself, I don't understand. Cause I think there's a lot of great guys here who are single. Maybe it's just the type you normally go for, idk 🤷🏾‍♂️ Hi 👋
Unconventional guy's unconventional friend here…
Hit me up","This final project feels like it will overwhelm me, but I trust in God. I have a crush on this girl, I really like her, but I don't think I am good enough. By the way, her name is Sally. I have the most supportive friends.  A big thank you to Tani!  A big thank you also to everyone in the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class. We made it this far; we will finish the course. It is ironic how some of you want to be treated like adults, but act like children.  Many thanks to the support center; those people are truly helpful. The Class of 2027 girls are very underrated. I disagree with what some people are saying; division is everywhere, but why would you use your parents' wealth to make others feel bad when we are having healthy conversations? No one is being bitter, but that is the truth, and the disrespect is unacceptable (I see how some of them make international students feel unwelcome and laugh at them). Please post this. We need a Class of 2025 boys support group. The hierarchy of wickedness in the school is Class of 2025, then Class of 2026, then Class of 2024 boys. The Class of 2027 boys will become wicked when the Class of 2028 girls arrive. You have made yourselves married couples in new MAS; when it casts, it will be bloody. Stop using your bare hands to move other people's laundry on the clothesline. Do you have no dignity? Put that high school behavior behind you. Do you still look down on people? 2024? Oh my goodness! To those who borrow chargers and power banks and do not return them, God is watching you. Grades really matter. You still have time to do better.  A piece of advice: Stop laughing in groups as girls when boys you do not like pass by; it is disgusting. A big thank you to Aisha from Akornor; she is genuinely nice. Today you have realized the wickedness of the Class of 2025 boys; you will learn the hard way. It serves any Class of 2027 girl right if she is mistreated by a senior. Some of you smell very bad; what is the meaning of this? It is a particular demographic I will not mention.  Is Obiaa shirt brand still relevant? Amapiano music is over, and I am happy about it.  Sports keeps some of us sane in this school. Must you always dress to attract attention? A big thank you to McNobert from Class of 2026. He really helped many of us with our Introduction to Artificial Intelligence assignment. If not for him, some of us would have failed. We love you, bro. Never trust a Ghanaian woman who swims. Oh mechanics! Do they seriously think the code for passport events will not be shared? Grading on a curve is completely unfair. Can you be more specific? Some of the Class of 2025 boys are innocent. Class of 2025 boys slander? I will be there! Demons indeed. Let us not forget the Class of 2026 girls; very wicked. That group of boys in Class of 2025… run girls, run! These ride-sharing company drivers cannot stop complaining about the Berekuso road.  There are so many Dufie ants; why? I need a Class of 2026 girl like Maisy to save my life. Please, the Class of 2025 boys have not done anything; you should rest. The Class of 2026 girls… very wicked. Only the on-campus Class of 2025 boys are wicked; the rest are good. Some of you, the Class of 2025 boys, have not done anything to you; you just want to feel included. That light-skinned boy with glasses in the on-campus Class of 2025 who likes reporting boys to their girlfriends, why are you jobless? Trouble for the Class of 2025 boys. Class of 2025 boys, please stop talking immediately. I do not know how I will survive the rest of my stay in this school when my crush graduates this year (he does not know I exist). Is everyone having sex on this campus? The Class of 2025 slander is too much (except for the DJ and his group; they deserve it). Zero romantic interest. I just follow you on Instagram and leave the rest to God. Why are the girls crushing on Class of 2025 guys? The Class of 2025 girls do not even do that.  Nana from Class of 2026 is so fine. The Class of 2026 girls are heavenly stunning, especially A****. Some of you talking badly about Class of 2025 on your stories do not know any Class of 2025 boys; I am certain of this. A big thank you to Hannah. I love her. I cannot wait for the Final Departmental Examinations to be over. I literally get upset every Tuesday and Thursday. I do not know why you people are targeting the Class of 2025 boys (because let's face it, it is only a select group of them that are wicked) when the real demons are in Class of 2024. A very wicked bunch; every single one of them. The Class of 2025 boys are actually way better; it is the Class of 2024 boys. Very wicked and inconsiderate. Thank God they are leaving. Goodbye, Hillside boys; you will not be missed. Belinda from Class of 2026 is so cute and friendly when you get to know her. I love her Instagram page. Wait until I tell your main girl what you are doing with that boy in Class of 2025. Why are people concerned about things that do not matter? I think everyone needs to grow up. Most ladies on campus, even guys, are not mentally mature for relationships. It is damaging when all we think of in a relationship is romance (for guys) and class (for ladies). Any relationship should be intentional and defined, otherwise it is just for playing around. We all know what we are doing! That one friend group in Class of 2025, only proceed with them if you hate yourself. Nothing to say about the other classes; let's focus on the problem. But you guys should have done a ban. We should have warned the girls earlier about the Class of 2025 boys. Now it is too late; they are already dating them.  I salute all the unfortunate souls dating these boys. Cook them! Cook them! They deserve it.  Especially those defending the Class of 2025 boys—you are part of the problem, and your mistakes will cause you immense regret.  A Class of 2026 girl left me for a Class of 2025 guy early in my first year, and my life has never been the same.  The wickedness is hierarchical; are the Class of 2024 boys at the bottom? Who taught the Class of 2025 and 2026 boys what they know? Why are you saying things about the DJ and his group anonymously?  The DJ does not have a “squad.” Are you afraid of the Class of 2025 boys? Even Class of 2025 girls do not act this way, yet the whole school knows who you are talking about.  It is funny how everyone says “Class of 2025 boys,” but we all know exactly which boys are being referred to. It makes sense that one of them is the intercom chairperson. “The DJ and his squad”—you people should shut up! If any of you have been wronged by a Class of 2025 boy, speak up.  By the way, is the DJ single? I am trying to make a move (even though they say he and his group are intimidating).  “Wait until I tell your girlfriend”—aren’t you embarrassed? Let me catch you. My boss, Richard! Dating in this school is difficult because everyone is always involved in your business.  You would be so disappointed in your current pre-marital activities if you were in fourth grade.  I reread old messages to ensure I do not miss anything.  You enjoyed your relationship with the Class of 2025 boys quietly; whatever happened, deal with it quietly. The Ink administration’s selective posting practices should be studied; their filtering system is strange. You post slander but ignore opinions and genuine concerns. Are you triggered by some of the facts? If you want, do not post this either. The truth remains the truth. I do not know what the school can do to foster unity and create a cohesive community. No matter what the school tries, it does not work. The community is very fragmented. The person who commented on The Ink’s selectivity is absolutely correct. Why would I post my opinion on the same topic twice, and you would overlook it? I am having a terrible day, but at least I did not bite someone’s neck and get suspended for four semesters.  ASC, pajama day?  Regarding the division, most international students do not care because there is life beyond their limited thinking that we lack ambition. The most ambitious students are international; they cannot compete or relate. Stop using your parents’ wealth to look down on people. Get a job. Why do schools make students walk in the rain and get sick for boring classes?  Ink Admin reveal? I read your interview with Maame Mensa-Bonsu and learned something insightful. However, what is the point of canceling the Dean’s List when there will be no clear way to show excellence and encourage others to excel by seeing others' names on the list?  Bring back the Dean’s List. That was a hasty decision. I love how my friend and I can talk about the Bible for hours, and it never gets old (hint for them: ES Playlist). It is difficult to be sentimental, but Belinda and Bernice (Class of 2025), I love you both so much. Bring back the Dean’s List. Can we stop pretending that segregation is not normal? Let us be kind and courteous to each other, but there will always be some division, so stop making it seem abnormal. Do your part, be kind to everyone, and accept that we cannot all act like one big family.  The shortest boy in school, Sedem, is hilarious. Good vibes in general. Most Ashesi girls are not as pretty as they think, but they are very arrogant. Most of them think their parents' wealth determines their beauty. If your tuition fees, your GPA, and your desire to pursue graduate studies do not motivate you to excel, then forget about the Dean’s List. Bragging rights were never the primary goal, but being on the Dean’s List provided validation for those who worked hard to excel. You cannot judge someone for wanting to be recognized for their success. Unless some other form of public recognition or reward is implemented, bring back the Dean’s List. My best friend is the most supportive and down-to-earth person ever. I am so happy she is in my life; I love and miss her so much. I appreciate the Ashesi students who still make an effort to talk to and befriend introverts. We are not mean; we are just reserved. Please be patient with us. So, you will not make a move on your crush again? I am grateful for the non-Ghanaian students. Among the very expressive people in our community, I am learning a lot from your culture, which is great! I love and appreciate all my university friends, especially those I met in my first year; I couldn't have survived without them. They are the best! I love that she loves chicken wings – 14643. So, without this dean's list, how would we know who the smart ones are when we need help? I love how she is affectionate towards me, Lady Marge…I just love her. She possesses high social and emotional intelligence. In every society, there is segregation. Let's accept that and live with each other peacefully. We know we are one big family (the Ashesi family, of course), but when it comes to individual relationships, we are the same people who look at each other and define our own boundaries. When you approach anyone, there is no guarantee they will choose to socialize with you based on their ""social status."" Just avoid rigidly defining your boundaries and expand your network on campus. It's that simple. Cheers! I just love how my girlfriend knows exactly what to say to me in every situation. And she is so beautiful, obviously. Top 3 girls on the planet, for real. Imaginary or not, she has my heart! I love that he cares about me deeply. He is not good at communicating but puts a lot of effort into talking to me. He smells great! He has a beautiful and generous heart. He is unconventional, too, and I like that about him. Ashesi may have many annoying people, but there are a few like him who remind you to be thankful.  Man, if you are on the dean's list, you know you are on it. No one wants to know. Keep it to yourself! Happy birthday, Anamalia, I love you so much. (Please post this for me today; it would mean so much to me.) To the person saying the school is segregated, the big question you should be asking is who caused it?  In fact, Ashesi students complain a lot, but I think the administration is partly responsible. Everyone is a hypocrite and living a lie! You can literally feel it. Cancelling the dean's list is necessary, in my opinion. You can find your motivation elsewhere. Moreover, you never know who your true friends are. Imagine being the only one there amongst your friends, yet you do things together. The world is getting riskier, my friend. A reality check is realizing that no one cares about your GPA if you are going into industry. A sad situation is realizing that a few of the 4.0 GPA students get good jobs, but a higher percentage of those with 3.5 GPAs or below get better/great jobs. This should clear your doubts. Do well, and let your motivation come from within. For the person waiting for motivation from the dean's list, I'm sorry. Your motivation should not come from others. Sooner or later, you will find yourself doing unnecessary comparisons. And as they say, comparison is the thief of joy. Shout-out to myself for playing both sides to always win. This capstone…only God knows. Or if I get some C's/D+'s, will I still graduate? They are not taking your grade away; if you need the dean's list for motivation, I suggest you re-evaluate your purpose here. Are they completely cancelling the dean's list, or are they just not posting it on the wall anymore? I think some recognition is definitely due, but no posting on the wall, please. I would recommend a personal email be sent to whoever makes the dean's list. This keeps the recognition without making it a public show-off. Whether you decide to tell other people or not is up to you. Can we do a lost and found for Wangari's laundry? They sometimes mix up people's clothes, really essential pieces, too. To the person who has an unconventional guy, please, what is his year group? It seems like we will share. Gems are rare to find. Oh, God. For legal and ethical reasons, I will unfortunately never be able to fully express how grateful I am for ChatGPT. I am slowly losing my ability to reason and analyze, but I am truly grateful. Nothing scares me more than the fact that the girls know that the Judicial Committee will be on their side if it is against a boy, and they know they have this secret weapon even if it is not warranted, like using it to punish you for something else under the guise of harassment. New update: ask her to record an audio of her giving consent to have sex with her, with the date and time and everything. If she says no, my friend, run, run like your mother's life depends on it. Is Amapiano music dead? Wait for an event. The cat is not fat—it's pregnant! Happy birthday to the amazing Pfungwa! Can't this boy just ask me out? So, you people won't mention your crushes by name? Are you people now shy? I've heard a lot of complaints about Ashesi guys, blah blah blah. But as a guy myself, I don't understand. Because I think there are a lot of great guys here who are single. Maybe it's just the type you normally go for, I don't know. Hi! Unconventional guy's unconventional friend here… Hit me up."

The anxiety attacks hit different when you randomly realize that a slight family emergency or cedi depreciation could mean you have to drop out.

The sports committee should not be deceitful this time. Kingsford? Someone undeserving will be awarded simply because… but congratulations anyway. UTSUN awards are causing people who do not know you or have not spoken to you since last year to spam your DMs.  Not even real conversations, just broadcast messages.  Crushing on someone's boyfriend is not easy. From butterflies in my stomach to jealousy to anger, the cycle repeats. This boy is resurrecting the dead butterflies in my stomach.

I mean, we are a liberal arts… Friend, so it should not only be evident in academics but also in all other aspects of life, including social interactions and events. I would make it socially liberal. The tension in this school is incredibly high. Why?  In my opinion, the Ashesi Junior College (AJC) is the reason for the dull social life here. Why can't we apply for financial aid after admission? The anxiety attacks are particularly intense when you suddenly realize that a minor family emergency or a decline in the value of the cedi could force you to withdraw from the university. If only Ashesi allowed students to apply for financial aid, perhaps annually, life would be much more manageable for some of us, knowing that we have a safety net. People's reactions to events and concerts are very uninteresting. The fees are extremely high. If I could change one thing about Ashesi, it would probably be the location, because commuting from Berekuso to Accra is very expensive.  Concentrate all the coursework in the first half of the semester; the second half should be dedicated to preparing for the final examinations."
Week 41,"Everyone’s obsession with maintaining their ’aura’ why is everyone so obsessed with maintaining their aura?

The energy with which we came with during orientation, it should have continued 😭. The random greetings have stopped ☠️ no one cares anymore  The people in charge of school fees. 
How can the dollar rate the school is using shot up from 12 to 15.7, even higher than the current dollar rate. 

My fees went up from 52k to 70k. 
Why❓❓❓ Banning 8ams This school is so wicked!!! No empathy at all. You know very well we are so exhausted yet you’re still doing things to continually exhaust us and frustrate us. And at first you’ll think the lecturers are the ones causing this frustration. But you realize it’s not even them. They are also being stressed out. We need the school heads to be more empathetic! They should drop their “we care about you act” and actually listen to students’ cries. There’s a limit to which you can load someone, they should know it! And let’s not even forget about the 70k Cedis price tag on all of this. As I said NO EMPATHY. 170k tuition this year alone when you know families were not prepared for this your “re-alignment year”. That does not even include housing, feeding etc. At the very least, be more empathetic to families that have multiple children enrolled here. Because some of us enrolled into this school when it was 24k tuition a semester.  Ashesi doesn’t take sports seriously. If they did campus free time should really be campus free time  Computer Science Syllabus  They should stop fattening us and calling it wellness, food doesn’t always make life brighter again!! They need to research more about what student wellness truly entails because they continually do a terrible job at finding a balance between achieving “academic and social excellence” and ensuring students overall wellbeing, they always sacrifice the latter! A rule that says guys should put on their pants properly. Like dude, why are you airing out your ass🤌 When are we going to realize that being real is okay?  What’s the essence of unpacking what I wish Ashesi could change when I know it won’t because people actually enjoy making others feel like crap? Ashesi bruised me! The people bruised me! The environment bruised me! Even if anything changes, what do I do with the pain I’ve been carrying for all these years? I’m not your friend because I want your man. It’s not you, it’s your man that I want. Her red hair burns like the rays of the sun, I see her and I am lit. For she is beautiful beyond compare, the girl with brown eyes and fire for hair. I thought Ashesi PR wasn’t supposed to advertise student business anymore? 👀 i thought that was Enterpreneurship Committee’s job now?  this girl wants to sell everything under the sun smh  sooo what’s the use of the Enterpreneurship committee? cus why am i seeing PR advertising buldak today? 🤣🤣 last week it was bagels 😭 hasn’t the grass in the courtyard recovered? why are we doing USTUN in the hive of all places? 😭😭😭 All these Ashesi boys that drive fast in the night, what if you hit Aunty Caro’s boy. Please calm down.  I now understand why they put instructions in the washroom. I appreciate the effort but they have to try something else because it seems people don't read. FLUSH THE F*CKING TOILET. Why was Raymond not nominated? What in table tennis didn't he win? The politics is too much. You this Evans guy, what have you played?🤣🤣 Casuals sef dey lash you Can munchies stop giving us spoilt food? You pay and get to your room to fill your belly but nahhh To everyone about to give up, don't. You need pain to to excel. It's difficult but you'll be happy. Tell yourself you're the light in the tunnel. You don't wait for the light at the end because you're the LIGHT Quomodocunquize Will definitely win something in relation to volleyball and/or football, she knows herself. Goal of the season 

Welile Chilly Dlamini 🤷‍♂️ There’s only one women’s football MVP 🐐.  It’s finally Prince Osei’s season. This semester needs to end already! We're all going nuts here—three projects due in the same week, my boyfriend dumped me, and I don't even have time to cry about it. Everything is moving at warp speed, and I can't keep up! Nasser for Football Most Promising  Eyiram Gaze is definitely getting most promising footballer - his roommate (Emma) When you see it's raining, do NOT walk on the orange tiles! Let me save your steeze Munchies employees are paid less than minimum wage. Apparently I have a boyfriend and I didn't know  You see that thing about change your pin else it won't work etc etc.  Na scam. I've been using the same pin for three days Why ya'll act confused when you know lowkey you might like someone? You're waiting for your soulmate? Wtf, girls just be delusional🚮 If you can't handle 11:59 pressure START EARLY.
It's starting to get annoying seeing some people unable to perform basic functions as the deadline draws closer.smh Food was decent 
We are still not forgiving your failed project I heard some people have been getting it on in their rooms. I thought we're all morally upright children of God 😂 The cat has gotten too comfortable on campus If you don't win today you are still a winner😂😂 Be proud, you were nominated. Nkd and Nkunim were robbed wtf  We need to get rid of that cat  Someone who isn’t even the best player on his team won the Player of the Year? Please tell me another joke!! This was the most biased show ever Honestly some people did not deserve their awards like WTH How can you tell us that Julia is better than Enyo???  Enyonam should have been keeper of the year!!! Awindor was robbed fr🫥 First of all, who sanctioned Amfo winning that MVP? Shame on all of you for not giving it to Prince. I think Pfungwa is ready to play with the boys now How and why did netball have so many categories? They are like 5 in the whole association  Juliann won some things she wasn't supposed to I was afraid they would rob Pfungwa of her MVP and Give it to Juliann The level of the women's football here is shockingly bad James Ice was robbed  Amfo for MVP was the robberiest robbery of all robberies!!! Like wtf!!! Another year, another robbery for Prince's MVP award. It's now ridiculous 😑  The integrity of these awards was unquestionable till we got to football,  then we got to MVP Amfo. That was it for all of us😤. AFA ≡ WWE Kasanoma is by far the most loved and most supported team on campus👏 Boss Baeta was ROBBED.  Amfo, return that award quickly  Volleyball should have had more categories, I mean, what is netball and why did they have enough categories to award everyone in the association?  It's true what they say. Engineering is a cult Ustun is rigged fr🤷🏾‍♀️ Even Amfo sef, e shock am. Good defender but definitely not best player of the year. the USTUN performance was just not it, tbh  yea Pfungwa has immense aura  Where are the Career Fair Pictures please? We didn’t stay in the queues for hours just not to receive them 😑 What is going on in dufie!? Why did I wake up to a family of ants plotting how they were going to climb my face NKD and Nkunim were robbed smh, one of the biggest robberies of the night  You guys have to stop with the fucking inclusivity and admit the Nigériens are damn weird. You mean to tell me you can't clean up after yourselves, you're loud and obnoxious and expect us to be nice to you when we're supposed to live with people like that??? Come on now. It's them you should be telling to be considerate and not us","Everyone is obsessed with maintaining their aura. Why? I would like to suggest that Ashesi University assign deadlines for the return of graded assignments. The school fees are exorbitant.  The isolation from the world is a problem. I appreciate the open and supportive environment where we help each other, a feeling reminiscent of orientation week.  However, that positive energy has dissipated; casual greetings are rare, and people seem unconcerned. The school's handling of fees is concerning. How did the dollar exchange rate used by the school jump from 12 to 15.7, exceeding the actual market rate? My fees increased from 52,000 cedis to 70,000 cedis. Why? The 8 a.m. classes should be abolished. This school is incredibly unkind and lacks empathy. We are exhausted, yet the school continues to add to our burden and frustration. Initially, it seemed lecturers were the source of this stress, but they too are overwhelmed.  The school administration needs more empathy, to move beyond performative caring and genuinely address student concerns. There is a limit to what students can endure, and the 70,000 cedis price tag for all this is unacceptable.  There is absolutely no empathy shown. This year's tuition is 170,000 cedis, a sum families were not prepared for, especially during this ""re-alignment year."" This figure excludes housing and food costs. At the very least, the school should show more consideration for families with multiple children enrolled. Some of us enrolled when tuition was 24,000 cedis per semester. Ashesi does not prioritize sports; campus free time should actually be free time. The computer science syllabus needs revision.  The school's wellness initiatives are misguided; providing food does not always improve well-being. The school needs to better understand student wellness and find a balance between academics and overall well-being; currently, well-being is always sacrificed. There should be a rule requiring students to properly wear their trousers. Why are some students exposing their underwear? We need to accept authenticity.  Why bother listing the changes I wish Ashesi would make when they will likely remain unchanged because people enjoy making others miserable? Ashesi, the people, and the environment have hurt me.  Even if changes occur, how do I process the years of pain? I am not interested in your friend; I want your boyfriend.  Her fiery red hair is captivating; her beauty is unmatched. I thought Ashesi's Public Relations department was no longer advertising student businesses?  That's the Entrepreneurship Committee's role, isn't it? This girl wants to sell everything. What is the point of the Entrepreneurship Committee if PR is advertising Buldak today and bagels last week? Has the courtyard grass recovered? Why is the USTUN event held in the Hive?  Ashesi students who drive fast at night, please be careful. You might hit Aunty Caro's son. Please slow down. I understand why there are instructions in the washroom, but the current method is ineffective; people don't read the signs. Please flush the toilet. Why wasn't Raymond nominated for table tennis? The politics are excessive. Evans, what have you accomplished? Even casual players outperform you. Can Munchies please stop serving spoiled food?  To those considering giving up, don't. Pain is necessary for growth. It is challenging, but you will find happiness. Remind yourself that you are the light at the end of the tunnel. You are the light. Quomodocunquize will undoubtedly win a volleyball or football award. Goal of the season. Welile Chilly Dlamini. There is only one women's football MVP. It's finally Prince Osei's season.  This semester needs to end. I am overwhelmed—three projects due this week, my boyfriend broke up with me, and I have no time to grieve. Everything is happening too fast. Nasser is promising in football. Eyiram Gaze will likely win Most Promising Footballer—his roommate (Emma) says so. When it rains, do not walk on the orange tiles. Munchies employees are paid less than minimum wage. Apparently, I have a boyfriend I didn't know about. The ""change your PIN"" messages are a scam; I've used the same PIN for three days. Why do people pretend to be confused about their feelings when they might like someone? Are you waiting for your soulmate? Some people are delusional. If you cannot handle last-minute pressure, start working early.  It is becoming irritating to see some people unable to complete basic tasks as the deadline approaches.  Sigh. The food was acceptable. We are still not over your failed project. I heard some people have been engaging in intimate relations in their rooms. I thought we were all morally upright children of God. 😂 The cat has become too comfortable on campus. If you do not win today, you are still a winner. 😂 Be proud; you were nominated. NKD and Nkunim were robbed. What the…? We need to get rid of that cat. Someone who is not even the best player on his team won Player of the Year? Please tell me another joke! This was the most biased show ever. Honestly, some people did not deserve their awards. What the…? How can you tell us that Julia is better than Enyo? Enyonam should have been Keeper of the Year! Awindor was robbed for real. 🫥 First of all, who authorized Amfo winning that MVP? Shame on all of you for not giving it to Prince. I think Pfungwa is ready to play with the more experienced players now. How and why did netball have so many categories? There are only about five people in the whole association. Juliann won some awards she did not deserve. I was afraid they would rob Pfungwa of her MVP and give it to Juliann. The level of women's football here is shockingly bad. James Ice was robbed. Amfo for MVP was the most egregious robbery of all robberies! What the…? Another year, another robbery of Prince's MVP award. It is now ridiculous. 😑 The integrity of these awards was unquestionable until we got to football, then we got to MVP Amfo. That was the breaking point for all of us. 😤 AFA ≡ WWE. Kasanoma is by far the most loved and most supported team on campus. 👏 Boss Baeta was ROBBED. Amfo, return that award immediately. Volleyball should have had more categories. I mean, what is netball, and why did they have enough categories to award everyone in the association? It is true what they say: Engineering is a cult. Ustun is rigged for real. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Even Amfo himself was surprised. Good defender, but definitely not the best player of the year. The USTUN performance was just not good, to be honest.  Yes, Pfungwa has an immense presence. Where are the Career Fair pictures, please? We did not stand in line for hours just to not receive them. 😑 What is going on in Dufie? Why did I wake up to a family of ants plotting how they were going to climb my face? NKD and Nkunim were robbed, sigh, one of the biggest robberies of the night. You guys have to stop with the forced inclusivity and admit the Nigeriens are damn weird. You mean to tell me you cannot clean up after yourselves, you are loud and obnoxious, and expect us to be nice to you when we are supposed to live with people like that? Come on now. It is them you should be telling to be considerate, not us."
Week 42,"Just tell him you like him already. Yes, I'm talking to you J.Joo can i just remind everyone that USTUN voting is literally not the final say of who gets what? it’s literally just to hype the program up, pleaseee. it’s like less than 30% of the final decision  why would you lie that your wig is your actual hair? ew please Ashesi, reduce our school fees and take away the destress and wellness wednesdays. we will be less stressed trust me.  I am addicted to plantain chips and Ghana jollof 😔 I’m secretly a crime fighting superhero in Paris by night and an academic weapons by day I've been suspended  I fucked someone in the kitchen. Beat sex ever!!! Would recommend 👌  Someone should please tell Tani that I like Salma ei😭 I have liked so many guys for the past 3 years, but I can't get the first one out of my mind I eat gari every night🥲 I'm sleeping with someone 10 years older than me C'25 boys have gooood dick That I like girls  A lot of you boyz are hella cute but either arrogant or too cool for school There are some cute 25 guys oooo. Doron, Alvin, Pascal, Henry, Likes.... especially the ones that hangout in 2D🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪 
None of my friends have a clue that I'm actually married with a four-year-old child. They all think my husband is my uncle and that my child is my younger brother. If they knew the truth, it would turn their world upside down,lol. this 27 girl has me going crazy  Fucked a 25 boy last week. No protection 🤪 Casa Bella has just fallen off! Nowadays they just keep the food overnight and warm it in a pack. The jollof tastes so horrible! It used to slap  There’s this girl that eats fufu everyday on her snaps and she’s like a bobby pin whatever she’s praying for, God me too Just tell him how you feel. You won't regret it even if the feelings are not mutual My friend's man is my sneaky link🤡she will never know My parents think I’m in school every weekend but the truth is I’ve not spent a weekend in the school💀 I caught feelings when I knew there was no possibility, because he gave the best relationship energy! I’ll just soak it all into these books, maybe me and grades will at least work out. Please, those who claim to have steeze so they can't participate in anything...including projects, be so fr I hope that as we are going to the normal semester, the deadlines become more reasonable. A project should never last one Ashesi week. I know I keep mentioning it, but how can my semester here at Ashesi fit neatly within a semester break at Academic City? I am friends with someone who eats fried rice WITH pancakes. There. I said it  12k for on-campus? That's two 2-in-a-rooms at Dufie Gold, I can start a business with that money! be so fr Is it The Hill Speaks if it's a few disgruntled voices? (me included👀) I've gone back to the boy Does the salma person know Tani is in charge of this😂😂 Crazy that I'm heating on my Gs girl. She's hot though🥵🥵 So hard being gay in Ashesi cause you want the babes but you can’t figure out who’s gay and who’s not. I'm batman i miss my old sl😂😂, not his personality, just the… romps sigh. my friends will kill me lmao.  i still think about that douchebag. but i really banged the door on my way out, so it’s stuck, there’s no going back. he probably hates me.  I want to kill myself but I am a coward You know what would be great to close out the semester? The choir singing 'when you believe' at the courtyard. A perfect piece  Sometimes I want to kms Sometimes, I look at people and I just want to bite them Ei, so you really posted it 😭 Tell Salma I said 'hey babe' 🌚 Is Doron dating anyone? 👀 Hunger wan kee me. Munchies only has plain rice and indomie eii I love her smile. It lights up the room. Her childish demeanour and youthful exuberance. Fuck, she has so many men who want her but she doesn't see it. How do I compete, Salma Sometimes I look normal but I just want somebody to buy me bread 😞 I hope I don’t get over-religious roommates next semester🌚 Thanks to our mech teacher for putting the die in dynamics A very big thank you to my friends, my safest place, and that annoying individual whom i happen to like.

I'm coming for my girl Fuck, her eyes, her fucking eyes I hate the way she smiles at everyone, especially the guys. Just why Salma, why. Reserve your smiles for just me

This is the one time I’ve been able to ever pick correct proper motivational friends😭 without them I’ve no idea how I’d have been able to survive till now on this campus, even now that we don’t have the same classes I’m feeling it. I love them so much fr💕💕 Can the lecturers please normalize giving out finals prompts at the beginning of the semester??? Especially if it’s a project or final paper. Let me work incrementally on my work and be fine tuning it as I go instead of expecting me to cram a whole semesters teaching into 2 -3 weeks😭 Exams week brings out he nastiest attitudes in everyone Shout out to that 26 baddie at New Mass that gave me directions to Charlotte. You really saved my phone. Shout out to Augustus Kofi Gaisie. I don’t know how I would have made it through this semester without this guy.

Without this guy, class would’ve been so boring. 🤌Hmmm Group works 
If u know u have a lazy attitude just don't join a group 
Opt to work alone 
Don't come and stress people 
I really mean it 
If you feel this applies to you, just make the change—it's not right to continue like this.
Even if u don't know show some concern 
Never and never dare to come and play with my grades
Thank you  There is sexual tension between me and my roommate.  Can the new hosanna managers stop making us carry germs into our rooms. What's all this?! In case you don't know how just continue thinking the liquid you walk in at 3am when going off campus is some miraculous spring💀 It's quite disrespectful to call me a 26' baddie, especially when I told you my name. Some of you 27s have to grow up. Lol, silly nerd Why are shots being fired all of a sudden?? ☠️ Friends are the key to surviving here at Ashesi
Shoutouts to Esinam, Michael, Awoye, Daniel and Austine I find it ridiculous how we as students are just selfish, to be honest. It’s like we forget the sacrifices that everyone had to make for this accelerated year, the staff , faculty etc ,yet we make the whole thing only about us. Most faculty would probably be on vacation somewhere but they had to stay here, teach you, try their best, mark scripts and deliver grades in a short space of time, what about their mental health? Or does it not matter? Everyone is just going through it, let’s be kind and continue trying our best. Ciao. Someone getting head at the student hangout. I’ve really been feeling this ‘27 girl but she’s known to be anti social and walks with only one boy. HMU love I have such a HUGE friend crush on Pfungwa and Kiki (Arthur's twin) like I wanna be friends with them soooooo baddddd my grades 🧎‍♂️ The most ridiculous thing on this campus is how people use others to their advantage and they make sure ,you indulge into them, and after getting their satisfaction, they ghost you, and see you like you don't even exist, some of you act like you lack home training, if you want people to use ,get them  elsewhere, stop putting people's children into stress of which they will forever ask themselves if they wronged you  somewhere yet it's your stupidity and childishness, some of you should grow up .......... Broo I legit saw this guy and his girl come out of her room, and the girl was holding her stomach the whole time I don’t know if she was sick or something else happened but her walking style was also ridiculous  Most ridiculous: Big Ben leaving 😭😭😭 
Bring back Big Benedict !!! #BBBB What if he just wanted to keep you private bruh. Can’t have everybody know there’s a baddie lurking First of all there is nothing insulting about being a nerd so the 26 girl should stop watching American movies that imply it’s an insult. Second of all, he complimented you. Relax it’s not that deep. Why should he name you? Relax pahn. Carry your body go rest  Calling someone a silly nerd because he called you a baddie is wildddd but oh well Gotta be sleeping guards 😂😂   Make the football ratings make sense. So everyone is 93+ good? Try watching FIFA or sth. We can't even repost cause it makes us all look stupid📌 A “proud” boyfriend on his way to other girls room to watch “movies” has to be one of the most ridiculous things I have seen  nothing. what’s there to laugh about 😐?? My roommate should hurry up and graduate please, I am tired The way I just noticed this boy this semester , and come to find out he now has a girlfriend. I’m in pains😭 I don’t want to want her man o, but how can I help it if the boy is funny and smart and cute and exactly my type?😭 Who is behind the ink?🧐 Still with the football ratings thread, kindly post so that PR knows👏we beg We’re in college! Read that again! All of you people who don’t wanna leave high school and keep acting like kids, kindly use the break to grow and learn that we’re adults(at least the majority of us)! Let people be responsible or make mistakes and own them! Stop making everyone feel shitty for walking with their friends or taking distances from some people or even getting new hobbies! I’m sick and tired of nursing you guys! Next sem, better change because Imma start calling out y’all’s bullshit and trust me, it won’t be fun! Also, please let people breathe, we all need grace!  I find it fascinating how some of you think because I don’t talk, I can take anything😂. Well, you’re not wrong, but it’s only because I treasure my scholarship because the depths of some people’s schemes is unimaginable😂. How’re we gonna disagree once and you take your vex to AJC masked as some serious assault? Anyway, what do I know?😂 Lowkey can’t wait to graduate and block y’all😂! Just keep treating me like crap, it makes things easier for me! Today somebody is cheating another day someone is cheating? Ad3n 💀 MENTION THEIR NAMESS!  The most ridiculous thing I've seen is people making you feel bad for wanting to stick to your Christian morals... I get it, we obviously weren't all raised the same but please stay in your lane as I stay in mine the funniest or most ridiculous thing? - my ex, that 🤡 Why are those on campus so stinky? Do you even bath or clean your rooms? I really hope the 27 girls “playing” with 26 and 25 boys are just sexually active and don’t think it’s romantic. If they think it’s romance that’s actually funny asf The number of Christian high students is actually ridiculous. They’re freaking 10% of 27. Does that even make sense. Wtf was the admissions team even thinking.  i can’t believe my crush is leaving fr. like i’m not going to see this boy walking the halls anymore??? damn it’s going to be one long boring year ahead for me  Hm. The day I connect to these Berekuso speakers erhnn.. The person talking about the accelerated semester should just stop. Cos guess who is getting paid and who is not. It’s hard on everybody yes, but it’s hardest the most on us students. Cos lord knows a lot of us could have used this summer for something . This was supposed to be my internship summer. But ALAS!!!!!! Let’s just all accept it’s a mistake that should not be repeated again  i once saw this couple kiss. ON CAMPUS. ON A BRIGHT SUNNY AFTERNOON. TONGUE AND ALL??? Awurade, this school wants to finish me I need like 2 weeks recovery period after this semester ends Is the roommate aware of the sexual tension? ""Is the sexual tension in the room with us? "" - The roommate, probably Chale all of you are clowns 🤡.These people are just trolling themselves  These Berekuso people why? 24/7 King Paluta ye People shaming other people for having sneaky links knowing fully well they want one too. Like since when do munchies call people by their food eerhhh....","Just tell him you like him already. Yes, I am talking to you. J. Joo, can I just remind everyone that the USTUN voting is not the final determinant of who receives what? It is merely to generate excitement for the program; it represents less than 30 percent of the final decision. Why would you lie about your wig being your actual hair? Please, Ashesi, reduce our school fees and eliminate Destress and Wellness Wednesdays. We will be less stressed, trust me. I am addicted to plantain chips and Ghanaian jollof. I am secretly a crime-fighting superhero in Paris by night and an academic weapons expert by day. I have been suspended. I had sex with someone in the kitchen. Best sex ever! Would recommend. Someone should please tell Tani that I like Salma. I have liked many guys for the past three years, but I cannot get the first one out of my mind. I eat gari every night. I am sleeping with someone ten years older than me. C25 boys have good penises. I like girls. Many of you boys are very cute, but either arrogant or too cool for school. There are some cute twenty-five-year-old guys: Doron, Alvin, Pascal, Henry, and others—especially those who hang out in 2D. None of my friends know that I am actually married with a four-year-old child. They all think my husband is my uncle and that my child is my younger brother. If they knew the truth, it would be shocking. This twenty-seven-year-old girl is driving me crazy. I had unprotected sex with a twenty-five-year-old boy last week. Casa Bella has declined in quality; they now keep the food overnight and reheat it. The jollof tastes awful; it used to be delicious. There is this girl who eats fufu every day on Snapchat, and she seems to get whatever she prays for; God, me too. Just tell him how you feel. You will not regret it, even if the feelings are not mutual. My friend's boyfriend is my secret lover; she will never know. My parents think I am at school every weekend, but I have not spent a weekend at school. I developed feelings when there was no possibility, because he exuded great relationship energy! I will just immerse myself in these books; maybe my grades and I will finally get along. Please, those who claim to be so stylish that they cannot participate in anything, including projects, be serious. I hope that, as we transition to a normal semester, the deadlines become more reasonable. A project should never last one Ashesi week. I know I keep mentioning it, but how can my semester here at Ashesi fit neatly within a semester break at Academic City? I am friends with someone who eats fried rice with pancakes. Twelve thousand cedis for on-campus accommodation? That is the cost of two double rooms at Dufie Gold; I could start a business with that money! Be serious. Is it truly ""The Hill Speaks"" if it is just a few disgruntled voices (me included)? I have gone back to the boy. Does the Salma person know that Tani is in charge of this? It is crazy that I am attracted to my gay friend's girlfriend. She is hot. It is difficult being gay at Ashesi because you want to date girls, but you cannot figure out who is gay and who is not. I miss my old lover; not his personality, just the sex. My friends would kill me. I still think about that jerk, but I slammed the door on my way out, so it is stuck; there is no going back. He probably hates me. I want to kill myself, but I am a coward. You know what would be a great way to end the semester? The choir singing ""When You Believe"" in the courtyard. Sometimes I want to kill myself. Sometimes I look at people and want to bite them. You really posted it? Tell Salma I said ""hey babe."" Is Doron dating anyone? I am starving. Munchies only has plain rice and Indomie. I love her smile; it lights up the room. Her childish demeanor and youthful exuberance. Many men want her, but she does not see it. How do I compete, Salma? Sometimes I look normal, but I just want someone to buy me bread. I hope I do not get over-religious roommates next semester. Thank you to our mechanics teacher for making dynamics challenging. A very big thank you to my friends, my safest place, and that annoying individual whom I happen to like. I do not think I would have survived this semester without you! Thank you! We probably will not talk as much next semester (an unwritten Ashesi principle), but I really appreciate you! Friends are really helpful; select them wisely. Shout-outs to my friends Daniel and Bartels; you guys made this semester much more bearable. Shout-out to book club; they were a breath of fresh air at a critical point in the semester. Shout-out to Prince Baah Mensah; he was like a cartoon character come to life to help all engineering students. Shout-out to Tanito. Shout-out to Allen Kpentey! An amazing fellow Wendy in C27. She is a sweetheart. My darlings, Intisser and Raicha in 27. To the sweetest guy on campus, Tani ""Tan Tan"" Olamiji, the prodigy. Alvin Brocke is the man of the moment. Prosperous Hollande, exceptional woman. Shout-out to me for being me and believing in me! I am taking this chance to shout... To my roommates, especially Alyce '26, Fatima, and Lewa, we all needed that laughter to get through this semester. These roommates brought so much positive energy into the room. To my friends, Noella, Aline, and Erica, let's do it again next semester!  Guys, a word of advice, do not fall for your female friends. Hilary Kwofie, I love and appreciate you so much; thank you for effortlessly taking care of me. To Candace, my best friend, thank you for being there.  Shout-out to Netflix for making this semester a little more bearable. Let's do it again next semester. Someone tell that ISPM lecturer to change his ways. With all due respect, we are all struggling this semester. So if you are romantically interested in me, be direct. There is no time for playing games and sending mixed signals. I will block you. Stop lying; no one is romantically interested in you. Why would you eat from a cup, leave the dirty cup on your bed, and sleep next to it for about two weeks, but look prim and proper when you go out? Shout-out to ODIP and the rest of the OSCA team! Shout-out to everyone who takes the time to check on how others are doing.  Those who are friends to everyone but a friend to no one—you are the real gems! Shout-out to Jox C'25, she is a sweetheart. Shout-out to Nana Akua Senanu for being beautiful. She made getting through the semester easier. I hardly saw her, but when I did, it brightened my day. I hope I am living the life that is mine because who is writing this story for me? Shout-out to Kharis Dadzie '27. She has been such a wonderful friend, ensuring I am up to date with my work. No shout-out, I just want to express my gratitude right now. Shout-out to the guy who is afraid of cats! Shout-out to Hilary Nana Ama Kwofi for being such a darling. Shout-out to my boyfriend back home for being my support system and making sure I do not break down during this Accelerated Year. No one will ever replace you, my love. I love you now, and I will love you forever. Shout-out to my eating partners, my study partners, and my Nigerienne roommates who annoy me every single day!  Honestly, I will miss the 24-hour shout-outs. I love all my friends. You guys always put a smile on my face, regardless of what I am going through. You guys are the best. Shout-out to Marion, Cindy, Joanne, and Lizz. Their energy is on another level. Monalisa '26, thanks for the interesting conversations we had. I will miss you. Edelin (I hope the spelling is correct), you are so pretty. Shout-out to “Be_Spirit” C'26 ladies. Heartfelt thanks for being the wonderful people that you are. Let's keep this amazing support system. Shout-out to Marion, Cindy, Joanne, and Lizz. Their energy is on another level. Shout-out to all the good people at Ashesi who genuinely care for the well-being of others. It means so much. Salma smells so good. The one in 27. She has the most alluring eyes. Sometimes, I just want to have sex with her slowly while I choke her. I have issues. Salma, Salma, Salma. Tani, watch out. I am coming for my girl.  I hate the way she smiles at everyone, especially the guys. Why, Salma, why? Reserve your smiles for me only. Watch your back, Tani. I am coming for my girl. So Tani and Salma are a couple? She is beautiful, though. I would date her. Shout-out to Salma in 27. She always encourages me when I am down. I had a presentation that went badly, and she was there to help me get better and practice for the next one. She always checks in when I am sad. A true friend. Love you, babe. Shout-out to Jonathan Odonkor. Legendary guy. A huge shout-out to my boyfriend. I really could not have made it through the semester without him. Nana Afia Pokua Ofori-Asante! An absolute gem. Thank you so much for making the semester bearable. We need a roommate chronicles since we will be having new ones next semester. Some of us have really struggled these three semesters. A wonderful shout-out to my roomies for this semester, Nadine and Hajar. You have been the best, and there is no doubt that we had a great time. Love you guys, and finish strong! And to all the friends I made this semester, thank you all for the love! Shout-out to Iycedelly! You are the best. I cannot say how much I am thankful for my Inner Circle (they know themselves). This is the first time I have been able to choose genuinely motivational friends. Without them, I have no idea how I would have survived until now on this campus, even now that we do not have the same classes. I love them so much. Can the lecturers please normalize giving out final assignment prompts at the beginning of the semester? Especially if it is a project or final paper. Let me work incrementally on my work and fine-tune it as I go instead of expecting me to cram a whole semester's teaching into two to three weeks. Exams week brings out the worst attitudes in everyone. Shout-out to that attractive person in 26 at New Mass. I received directions to Charlotte. You truly saved my phone.  A big thank you to Augustus Kofi Gaisie. I do not know how I would have managed this semester without him.  More accolades to my amazing friend Josephine Allan. I am truly grateful. I could not have done better.  Shout out to Sipa Blay for making all our classes so engaging and dynamic. Without him, class would have been incredibly boring. Hmm, group work. If you know you have a lazy attitude, please do not join a group. Choose to work alone. Do not add stress to others. I am serious. If this applies to you, please change your behavior; it is not acceptable to continue like this. Even if you are not aware of your actions, show some consideration. Never, ever jeopardize my grades. Thank you. There is romantic tension between my roommate and me. Can the new Hosanna managers please stop us from bringing germs into our rooms? What is all this? In case you do not know, the liquid you walk through at 3:00 AM when leaving campus is not some miraculous spring; it is quite disrespectful to call me a twenty-six-year-old attractive woman, especially after I told you my name. Some of you twenty-seven-year-olds need to mature. Lol, silly nerd. Why are accusations being made so suddenly? Friends are key to survival here at Ashesi. Shoutouts to Esinam, Michael, Awoye, Daniel, and Austine. I find it absurd how selfish we students are, to be honest. It is as if we forget the sacrifices everyone made for this accelerated year—the staff, faculty, etc.—yet we make it all about ourselves. Most faculty would likely be on vacation, but they stayed here, taught us, did their best, marked scripts, and delivered grades in a short time. What about their mental health? Or does it not matter? Everyone is struggling; let us be kind and continue trying our best. Goodbye. Someone is engaging in intimate activity at the student hangout. I have strong feelings for this twenty-seven-year-old girl, but she is known to be antisocial and only associates with one boy. Message me, I have a massive crush on Pfungwa and Kiki (Arthur’s twin); I want to be friends with them so badly. My grades. The most ridiculous thing on this campus is how people use others for their advantage, ensuring you indulge them, and then ghosting you afterward as if you do not exist. Some of you seem to lack proper upbringing. If you want people to use you, find them elsewhere. Stop stressing others unnecessarily; some of you need to mature. I literally saw this guy and his girlfriend leave her room, and the girl was holding her stomach the entire time. I do not know if she was ill or something else happened, but her walk was also unusual. Most ridiculous: Big Ben leaving. Bring back Big Benedict! What if he just wanted to keep you private? You cannot have everyone know there is an attractive woman around. First, there is nothing insulting about being a nerd, so the twenty-six-year-old girl should stop watching American movies that portray it as an insult. Second, he complimented you. Relax; it is not that serious. Why should he name you? Relax. Go rest. Calling someone a silly nerd because he called you a baddie is unbelievable, but oh well. Gotta be sleeping guards. Make the football ratings make sense. So everyone is 93+ good? Try watching FIFA or something. We cannot even repost because it makes us all look stupid. A “proud” boyfriend on his way to another girl’s room to watch “movies” has to be one of the most ridiculous things I have seen.  Nothing. What is there to laugh about? My roommate should hurry up and graduate; I am tired. The way I just noticed this boy this semester, and now he has a girlfriend. I am heartbroken. I do not want to desire her boyfriend, but how can I help it if the boy is funny, smart, cute, and exactly my type? Who is behind the ink? Regarding the football ratings thread, please post so that public relations knows. We beg you. We are in college! Read that again! All of you who do not want to leave high school and keep acting like children, please use the break to grow and learn that we are adults (at least the majority of us)! Let people be responsible or make mistakes and own them! Stop making everyone feel bad for walking with their friends, distancing themselves from some people, or even getting new hobbies! I am sick and tired of babysitting you all! Next semester, things will change because I will start calling out your nonsense, and trust me, it will not be fun! Also, please let people breathe; we all need grace. I find it fascinating how some of you think that because I do not talk, I can endure anything. Well, you are not wrong, but it is only because I value my scholarship because the extent of some people’s schemes is unimaginable. How are we going to disagree once and you take your anger to the Academic Judicial Committee masked as some serious assault? Anyway, what do I know? Wow! 😂 I secretly cannot wait to graduate and ignore you all! 😂 Just keep treating me poorly; it makes things easier for me!  Today, someone is cheating; another day, someone else is cheating?  Goodness! 💀  TELL ME THEIR NAMES! The most absurd thing I have seen is people making you feel bad for wanting to uphold your Christian values. I understand we were not all raised the same, but please mind your own business as I mind mine. The funniest or most ridiculous thing? My ex, that clown! 🤡 Why are the students on campus so smelly? Do you even bathe or clean your rooms? I truly hope the 27 girls ""dating"" 26 and 25 boys are simply sexually active and not thinking it's romantic. If they think it's romance, that's actually very funny. The number of Christian high school students is ridiculous. They are a mere 10% of 27. Does that even make sense? What were the admissions officers thinking? I cannot believe my crush is leaving for real. Like, I am not going to see this boy walking the halls anymore???  Darn, it is going to be a long, boring year for me. Hmm. The day I understand these Berekuso people… The person advocating for the accelerated semester should stop. Because guess who is being paid and who is not? It's hard for everyone, yes, but it's hardest on us students. Because many of us could have used this summer for something else. This was supposed to be my internship summer. But alas! Let's all agree it was a mistake that should not be repeated. I once saw a couple kiss. ON CAMPUS. ON A BRIGHT SUNNY AFTERNOON.  TONGUE AND ALL??? Lord, this school is going to exhaust me. I need at least two weeks to recover after this semester ends. Is the roommate aware of the sexual tension? ""Is the sexual tension in the room with us?"" —The roommate, probably. Friend, you are all clowns. 🤡 These people are just making fools of themselves. These Berekuso people, why?  King Paluta 24/7. People shaming others for having casual relationships, knowing full well they want one too.  Since when do people who crave casual relationships call others by their food, huh?"
Week 43,"AUNTY CARO NEEDS A COMPETITOR. That woman will keep you there for 2 hours and smiling. Then insult you when you ask for the wrong change. Heiiii. She must be humbled. And also free that 12 year old boy she uses for child labour. And she must start wearing gloves.  There’s one C‘25 guy I have not been seeing around? Infact, for the whole semester 🥹pookie where are you?🤧 Your Ghanian wife misses you🫶🏽😭I promise to tell you who I am when I see you again.
#internationallove🇰🇪🇬🇭 How do we study hard in the sem and you bring a compulsory question one cannot even solve? This is sheer wickedness because how do I wrap my head around this, I cannot fail this course too. It's not even funny at all... You never even calculated finding Y using Disposable income and taxes, yet you bring this as compulsory which we can’t find our way around it. Macroeconomics (never underestimate this course)….. never suffered in an exam like today… The Macroeconomics final exam percentage should be changed to 20% or 25%, it’s not fair for final exam to determine whether you fail or pass(it’s not funny). Am I going to fail macro, Oh God. There's heat in my head rn. To the macro paper that we just wrote 😭😭😭, I dedicate this song to all BA C'26
""God is with us! So our great Forefathers sang."" Go home before you think of texting that boy, I promise you he has not changed  After battling with exams you have to deal with anxiety from results later. It’s an endless cycle  I have some serious crush on this girl, but she has a boy. The annoying thing too is that I am fresher and have a better personality than the boy Ei macro hm On a more serious note, The economics department really did the macroeconomics students dirty... tell me why a compulsory question will be one that we've never seen before. I was this close to getting an A+ in macro but as it is now only God can decide my fate hmm I’m gonna Miss Tatenda fr ,  After you’re done with a course, all you can do is pray. I don’t want to hear anyone complaining about things out of their control 🙏 I still don’t get this honor code thing. I thought it meant no invigilators in the exam hall when the exam starts. Someone explain 🤧 I might scream after finishing FDE  We made it to the end. I think we all deserve toffee 🥳 Dennis Owusu…hmm A huge shoutout to Doron! He dedicated all his time to help with this course, making my heart melt with gratitude 😭😭 Sending tons of love and appreciation your way 🫶🏽🫶🏽 Chale, why we dey write exams sef?😖 Masa macro 👎🏾 material science is overrated anyways🥲 you know it's bad when there's 70 objectives and you had to guess 30 why do lecturers like going 'oh the exam is going to be easy, oh it's basic stuff' when you know DAMNNNN WELLLLL you're bringing extra stuff😭 how was I to know😭 The Lord will fight for me and I shall hold my peace😭 At least now I don't have to worry about being our grades being reduced for the curve Dr Edgar really cooked bitter food and forced it down our throats 😭😭😭 What is this guy doing to this girl that she's screaming like this...

Vim  ""babe, it's sem over, not love over😭😭"" That be what I hear rn oo...Ereach ur man🤣🤣 The C’25 boy is hustling in Silicon Valley. Hang tight babe, he creating the generational wealth for you  ASC needs to stop disgracing the free food ambassadors 😭 I can’t allow Ashesi to kill me o Not exam related, but there is this 26 girl. I honestly think she's the most beautiful person in this entire school. Like how can one person be so perfect. We've not met yet but when we do there's no going back. It's only a matter of time. Oh and yeah about the exams just pray and hope for the best and let God do the rest, you barb! I can feel their absence approaching, even as I hold on, pretending we have more time. The thought of you leaving feels heavy, though I know it’s certain. There’s an emptiness growing in my heart, hard to describe, harder to handle. I struggle with the truth, knowing you have to move on to something better. Yet, a quiet sadness lingers—I miss you already, in ways I can’t quite put into words . Hope it finds you well !!  Someone please tell this cat to stop giving me side eyes while l have my lunch.
I'm tired and scared‼️😭✋️ My favourite person in 27 is leaving. God 😭😭😭. I’ll miss you b 🫶🏼 Signed the honour code in first year , third year now and I’ve never written even 1 quiz without an FI invigilating. Was it all a joke? We that signed and the people that didn’t append their signature what is the difference? Thank God for peripheral vision, cos the way I’m ogling this boy, if I had to stare directly he’d probably think I’m a freak When I actually like a boy, my first instinct is to pretend the boy does not exist and loudly make people think I like someone else. Is that normal? Waakye and Pancakes?? masa masa masa…aswear chat gpt deserves a degree cuz eiii All my C’2024 Engineering fam.. I’ll miss you niggas😭. They said they won’t allow me to graduate  To the 24s, go and be living waters to a thirsty land 🙏 11:59 is no more scary. Make it 6:59!!

That woman will keep you there for two hours, making you smile, then insult you if you ask for the wrong change.  She needs to be humbled.

Where is the C'25 guy I haven't seen all semester?  My Ghanaian wife misses you terribly. I promise to tell you who I am when I see you again.  #internationallove🇰🇪🇬🇭

How can we study hard for the semester, only to have a compulsory question we cannot solve? This is sheer wickedness. I cannot fail this course.  It is not funny at all. You did not even teach us how to find Y using disposable income and taxes, yet you made that a compulsory question. Macroeconomics (never underestimate this course)... I have never suffered so much in an exam. The final exam percentage should be changed to 20% or 25%; it is unfair for the final exam to determine whether you pass or fail.

I have a serious crush on this girl, but she has a boyfriend.  The annoying thing is that I am a fresher and have a better personality than him.  Seriously, the economics department treated the macroeconomics students unfairly. Why would a compulsory question be one we have never seen before? I was so close to getting an A+ in macroeconomics, but now only God can decide my fate. I will miss Tatenda. After finishing a course, all you can do is pray. I do not want to hear anyone complaining about things beyond their control. I still do not understand this honor code. I thought it meant no invigilators in the exam hall. Someone please explain.

He dedicated all his time to help with this course, making my heart melt with gratitude. Sending tons of love and appreciation your way.  Why are we writing exams? Macroeconomics is bad. Material science is overrated anyway. You know it's bad when there are 70 objective questions and you had to guess 30. Why do lecturers say, ""Oh, the exam is going to be easy, oh it's basic stuff,"" when you know they are including extra material? The Lord will fight for me, and I will hold my peace. At least now I do not have to worry about our grades being reduced for the curve. Dr. Edgar really served us a bitter pill. What is this guy doing to this girl that she is screaming like this? I hope it is Africana music.

Week 44,"Shout out to the lecturers who for some reason are still keeping the grades and raising my blood pressure.

Why is one piece of bread 4 cedis 😭 Honestly I missed the cat at Akonor 😭 Very greedy and monopolistic vendors for a so-called ethical institution!!!!!!  This was definitely not the first week. We are already in the middle whether you like it or not  If at your big age, your aim on campus is to 'look cool'. then idk that's really childish and cringe. Not participating in class/coming in late makes you look weird, not cool. This aint high school Go back to the old colours We have crushes that we always want to see but this semester #that'snotthefocus","Leaving that person behind, giving my friends and me sufficient time, focusing on my studies, and trusting God's plan! That is my approach this year! Ashesi, bring it on!  I am ready.  I just want to go home. Open Canvas. Respectfully, I will postpone that.  And then proceed to the agenda. You all should vote for a capable president. Why is a single loaf of bread four cedis? Honestly, I missed the cat at Akonor. Very greedy and monopolistic vendors for a supposedly ethical institution! This was certainly not the first week. We are already in the midst of the semester whether you like it or not. If, at your advanced age, your goal on campus is to ""look cool,"" then I do not know; that is truly childish and embarrassing. Not participating in class or arriving late makes you appear strange, not cool. This is not high school. Let us revert to the old colours. We have crushes we always want to see, but this semester, that is not the priority."
Week 48,"Surprise surprise vogueFinds is doing sales😲. Style Sizzle🔥🔥 take advantage.  (writing with a lot of excitement)
Seriously Tani you shouldn't have apologized, the issue was worth the wait!!
and as for Kiki and Fridah, if I fail my quizz tomorrow it will be on you because how can you write so beautifully and so truthfully and expect me to continue the prep? 
Tbh, this was by far the best issue I've ever read Is spending the whole night studying , then dozing off during classes the next day a thing now??🤨👎 Atp we should just give the ASC dues away to charity because no one comes for the events","Wow! VogueFinds is having a sale! Style Sizzle—take advantage!

Seriously, Tani, you should not have apologized; the issue was worth waiting for!

And as for Kiki and Fridah, if I fail my quiz tomorrow, it will be your fault. How can you write so beautifully and truthfully and expect me to continue preparing?

To be honest, this was by far the best issue I have ever read. Is spending the whole night studying, then dozing off during classes the next day, now a common thing?  We should just donate the ASC dues to charity because nobody attends the events."
Week 49,"The “friends” you are laughing with about someone’s matter are also spreading your matter to others the same way. Be wise. When is Varsity League starting? Please invite ACity I haven't heard from the Sports Committee this semester, and we are entering 4th week!! Since she changed her locks she hasn't been the same. It doesn't matter what parliament says, the rule of unassigned assigned seats is an unspoken one and shouldn't be broken. Why are you stealing seats three weeks into the semester? It's okay if you didn't get the seat you wanted. Move on and stop making life difficult ","The people you are laughing with about someone else's problems are also gossiping about your own affairs in the same manner. Be cautious. When is the Varsity League commencing? Please invite ACity. I have not received any communication from the Sports Committee this semester, and we are already in the fourth week!  Since she changed her hairstyle, she has been acting differently. Regardless of what the student government says, the unwritten rule about unassigned seats is well-known and should not be violated. Why are you taking seats three weeks into the semester? It is acceptable if you did not get your preferred seat. Move on and stop causing problems."
Week 50,"Honestly Ashesi must just be the death of me Stressed,tired,exhausted and oh did I say stressed😩  I'm feeling like we've been in school for 8 weeks. 😭 Is it just me or has the ink been awfully silent this sem
 These ints really be stressing merhnn There is this boy in 27. He's really tall. Cut your high top my guy🙈 Am I the only one who still hasn’t got everything together? I’ve never been this confused in all my 3 years! I got no idea what I’m doing😩  I know some of you wash you towel once a semester, why? Your roommate is probably dying in there and they can’t tell you ! Hmm. change wai🤢 What happened to the white tables at Big Ben? Please bring them back. Can we all stop pretending we care more about learning than grades??
If you claim you learned so much and the course was so impactful but you got a C, you can't lie and say you're content with that.
Stop saying what you think the school wants to hear and say your mind😒 Maame Mensah's class is actually very insightful and fun. You guys were lying Saying excuse me before loudly interrupting someone doesn't make it okay. It's just weird and upsetting. 
Also, why are you shouting? They're right beside you. The whole class doesn't need to know what you're telling them How do you tell a boy that you just want to have fun and not have anything serious and tell another boy you don’t want to do anything at all with him? ( it’s an actual question ) so Ashesi actually won’t post about the protests at all??? lowkey disappointed Patrick didn’t take any opportunity to express support for #FreeTheCitizens himself the ASC tried for us by having that discussion about stopping galamsey the way Ashesi students didn’t show up for the talk abt galamsey… it will shock them when water at Essentials is 25 cedis Ato is actually a great academic co-chair, especially when you know him personally","Honestly, Ashesi is overwhelming. I am stressed, tired, exhausted, and did I mention stressed? I feel like we have been in school for eight weeks already. Is it just me, or has the workload been unusually light this semester?  These assignments are incredibly stressful. There is this very tall boy in room 27.  Am I the only one who still feels disorganized? I have never been this confused in my three years here! I have no idea what I am doing. I know some of you wash your towels only once a semester—why? Your roommate is probably suffering from the smell, and they cannot tell you!  Please change your habits. What happened to the white tables at Big Ben? Please bring them back. Can we all stop pretending that we care more about learning than grades?

If you claim to have learned a lot and that the course was impactful, but you received a C, you cannot honestly say you are content with that.

Saying ""excuse me"" before loudly interrupting someone does not make it acceptable. It is weird and upsetting. Also, why are you shouting? They are right beside you. The entire class does not need to hear your conversation. How do you tell one boy that you just want to have fun and nothing serious, and tell another boy that you do not want anything at all to do with him? (This is a genuine question.) So Ashesi will not post about the protests at all? I am secretly disappointed. Patrick did not take any opportunity to express support for #FreeTheCitizens himself. The attempt by the Ashesi Student Council to have a discussion about stopping galamsey, and the way Ashesi students did not show up for the talk about galamsey… it will shock them when water at Essentials costs 25 cedis.

Week 51,"If you’re in first or second year doing CE switch to either CS or EE If you went for the protest discussion, what has changed?

Ashesi takes a toll on the mind and body Let me screen those breasts Are you guys just looking for oddly dressed humans for the ‘outfit of the week’ or what?! No shade😗, but the actual cool outfits can be counted by finger","If you are in your first or second year studying Computer Engineering, switch to either Computer Science or Electrical Engineering. If you attended the protest discussion, what has changed? What new information did you receive, and what have you done with it? What is the difference between those who went and those who did not? This semester feels rushed. Handsome men are at Ashesi. Do not live a fake life to impress others. You can learn from someone you admire, but do not change your authentic self to fit into a particular group. Stop submitting assignments at the last minute.  Seriously, please stop! A two-day break would not be bad at all! Do a background check before you give that boy a chance; there is a reason for that. Some Muslim girls here are secretly very pretty. I have said it!  The honors students do not need to say we will not write the mid-semester exam because how did we get here so soon? The loudest person in the room is not necessarily the smartest.  Pursue your own academic goals; do not be intimidated by anyone. Sending hugs during this mid-semester period. I am secretly attracted to the dark-skinned twenty-seven-year-old with the amazing fashion sense at Hillside. If you see a Computer Science student in building 26, just hug them. The school is becoming too boring—only the Creative Festival happened. What is going on? Stop chewing gum so loudly and making that “tatata” noise; I really beg you. It is okay to break down occasionally. Ashesi takes a toll on the mind and body. Let me check those breasts.

Week 52,"Someone should tell the JEC to organize a presidential debate  We didn’t want to hear Newton’s quotes but rather his thoughts. International students are once again the bait cause now we’re supposed to expect Independence Day funds from a committee that has continually promised but failed to give ISA funds?  While Samuel and Yvette have clear chemistry for the vision. Jessie is like a supporting character to Newton’s ambitions.  Newton shouldn’t have answered the question about the criteria cause his criteria was a non scholar, who’s not an engineering student and lives off campus. Are those really the key qualities Jessie brings to his table?  Aren’t we all tired of buzzwords like change, diversity, leadership and change?  i hope there’s more drama in the manifesto readings We are equal to the people we roast on the Internet if we not inform ourselves about both parties before we vote. Listen to what both sides have to offer before you give in. Peace✌️
 That question to Nana Yaw was personal. More of that during the manifesto reading please!  69.3? Eiiiii Why are you telling me that your ideal vice should be a non-scholar who lives off-campus, all in the name of diversity? Upon all the qualities Jessie has, that's what you could mention??? Damn Can people start switching off stuff they are no longer using? I have been turning off fans, microwaves, lights, and heaters since my first year. Kindly turn off items when not in use.  I used to sleep while using my pc and my roommate would come keep it for me. That roommate taught me that our room was supposed to be our safest place, and she actually made a home far from home, for the both of us. My best roommate if you ask me! I just pray blessings over her🥹❤️!  Staying peacefully the entire semester until one day she decides that she's allergic to wood, therefore the study table can no longer be put next to the bed closing the gym because of someone’s silly mistake is just like canceling a course because someone cheated. someone’s mistake should not affect my gym progress. it takes a lot to be sacrifice and dedication over there in the first place, spending 3 hours (workout, eat, shower) consistently for your progress to be cut off. then starting all over again. no!!! Everything she says has to be done, I don’t have an opinion, and she loves to bang doors that the entire building shakes from the intensity  He used to dine with dirt. On top of all that, mandem's body odour really hit different. His girlfriend moved in and I now became more of a visitor to the room  This person never understood boundaries, they were very unclean and had a weird smell to them. OGs know the one As you are reading this, I hope you know you're 'that' roommate. In another world, I never want to be paired with you anymore, even for cash. I hope you meet more people to straighten your behaviour and teach you the essence of respect, neatness, boundaries and verbal training. My roommate used to spend not less than 6 hours in the washroom so I used to joke with others that he went to Narnia cause that was the only logical explanation  The person was incredibly dirtyyy. Like did mommy and daddy not train you on how to be clean? And why would you wake up and choose to overpopulate the room with your friends, forgetting you own only 50% of the room? If only their significant other knew who/what they were dating. They deserve better than this catastrophe I understand being messy like your things are all over the place (not really but it's better), but leaving ROTTING FOOD around the room is where I draw the line My roommate's boyfr6asked me for head 🤢 My previous roommate was a lot. She was messy and loud, but she went through a lot. I hope she's in a better place now  Saw my girl today........ looking as radiant as ever. Hi Salma. Welcome back, love. I resonate sooo much with the one who said he feels like a visitor. Just don’t do that. People like that ruin the entire semesters for people. I don’t think there is a greater form of selfishness. You could do it anywhere else on the earth; why a few feet away from me??? Btw, are Tani and Salma still together?👀  Asking for a friend👀 If you're going to have your girlfriend staying over every night please get a one in a room. Some of us would like to sleep without hearing funny noises  Hats off to class of 2025; Cupid didn’t miss this time around . Everyone  is in a relationship  One unexpected night, when I had just finished taking a shower, her boyfriend came to our room, knocked once and entered (like bruuh, are a roommate now?)… bet he saw the whole of my body🥲. But the guy was humble and respectful enough to come back and apologize to me. Tell me why she got angrier than me and even started making it look like I was trying to steal her man👀😂💔. Maybe he liked what he saw, but was that my fault? lmao😂💔 I stopped using our room’s toilet because she always left both the toilet and the bathroom dirty😭, and she puts on an attitude when you mention it. I got tired of cleaning more than twice a day 🥲. Now all her friends hate me because I talked about a serious issue that could even lead to some dangerous illness!

The way she looks clean and pretty outside, I bet she deceives you boys🥲. Beware! I prayed to God to give me a new, organized, kind roommate. God did it y’all😭🙌🏼. She’s peaceful. She’s giving me a whole new energy I had never got in Ashesi for 3.0years … especially from someone from a different country as mine.
She even wakes me up sometimes when I’m about to miss classes 🥹🫶🏼.I’m not used to her yet, but she gives me a home in the room. I love the person you are, roomie 🫶🏼. 

Hint hint: she’s RA in some hostel😁🫶🏼. She used to bring all the local foods in the room, and it made the room so not for me (the smell). I’d literally come back when it’s time to sleep at night. Her boyfriend used to visit around 00:00, and they’d literally start kissing in my eyes🥲. My innocence got abused😭💔, and they made the loneliness in Ashesi hell for me 🥲. If you have problems with your roommate, you are old enough to confront them gently about it. Stop being cowards who hid behind anonymity to vent.  Ei is it the same class of 2025 I’m in? Did Cupid pass me by??? They might as well openly tell us that this is an accelerated semester too🤷🏻‍♀️.
Mid-sems are doing what they do the most-searching and sorting by divide-and-conquer🌝! Do other girls also get jealous of their friends?  Can’t wait to go home, see my dogs and my parents and my bed. Funny thing is I know after midsem will be more mentally draining and this is a distraction 🤣🤣🤣 This midsem is not a break because why do I have 3 assignments and 2 groups works to work on??
Might as well just stay in school🥲 Can people please stop coming to our rooms to sell clothes ? If I wanted to buy some I’d slide in your dm. I struggle with saying no so you at my doorstep just makes me feel like I have to buy even if I don’t want to Ashesi midsem is basically not going to class. Cos tell me why I have so many submissions during the break😭😭😭 There’s a degree only God can fix💀 Is it even a midsem break when I have papers right after the break? Some people are allergic to certain animals and wouldn’t even want to be around them, let alone eat with them nearby. There’s been a cat hanging around Akornor for about two semesters now, and it feels like no one’s doing anything about it. I’m not sure if it’s the ASC’s responsibility, but something needs to be done, frfr. This midsem , can A+ just start from 40%   I’m just tired
-from the the bottom of my heart chewing gum like it’s a grenade in your mouth😭what at all?? Men who don't understand that screaming and thrashing isn't the only way a woman expresses that she doesn't want to be touched
It doesn't have to be rape to be non consensual  Rn dierr wherever I pass, tuba sheshe  guuurrllss, EmpowerHER is cooking a some girls event in November 🤭 Some of y’all are academically intelligent but also emotionally, socially and morally unintelligent and backward.

No entitlement here though, but can those who have rides during breaks allow some of us join them?

You usually wear earth tones or black. You have a Nana in your name 🙈. Need you. But unfortunately the people you hang out with are terrible 25 boys. Yes that squad. So I know you’re not good either. But maybe you can prove me wrong??? There's this tall dark handsome and funny guy in 27, he's in my stats class and I think he plays a sport,  probably basketball or volleyball.

Her name starts with “A” ,she’s in 27,one of the cutest people I have ever met,walks like a model,her hostel starts with “T”.Her smile is so pretty.I wish you were mine I’ll treat you like the angel you are. You’re the language I’m no longer fluent in but I still remember. Come back please 2025 white civic coming for you🙂‍↕️ Light skinned engineering lady(2025)…got a man? Someone asked me if I liked you, and I told them I didn't. But from how giddy I felt when I had to look into your eyes, how shyly I couldn't hold your gaze, how I had to mask my nervousness with giggles, to how I went to bed blushing from remembering the moment. I can, without a shred of doubt, say that I like you in fact, I do more than like you.               	
My plantain chips, I know you love bread. So, Can I share the space that bread holds in your heart?
 There’s this girl in C’26, cute, used to have a pink hair and currently having just 3 braids on. She gives me a stubborn girlfriend vibe, can we be a couple?","Someone should tell the Joint Electoral Commission to organize a presidential debate.

That question to Nana Yaw was personal.  Let's have more of that during the manifesto reading, please! Sixty-nine point three?  Goodness! Why are you telling me that your ideal vice-president should be a non-scholar who lives off-campus, all in the name of diversity? Of all the qualities Jessie possesses, that is what you choose to mention?  Seriously? Can people start turning off appliances they are no longer using? I have been turning off fans, microwaves, lights, and heaters since my first year. Please turn off items when not in use. I used to sleep while using my PC, and my roommate would turn it off for me.

He used to eat with unwashed hands. On top of that, his body odor was truly overwhelming. His girlfriend moved in, and I became more of a visitor in the room. This person never understood boundaries, they were very unclean, and had a strange smell. Those who have experienced this know exactly who I'm talking about. As you are reading this, I hope you know you are 'that' roommate. In another life, I never want to be paired with you again, not even for money. I hope you meet more people who will correct your behavior and teach you the importance of respect, cleanliness, boundaries, and communication skills. My roommate used to spend at least six hours in the washroom, so I used to joke with others that he went to Narnia because that was the only logical explanation. The person was incredibly dirty. Did your parents not teach you how to be clean? And why would you wake up and choose to overpopulate the room with your friends, forgetting that you only own 50% of the room?

I understand being messy, like having your belongings scattered everywhere (not ideal, but better), but leaving rotting food around the room is where I draw the line. My roommate's boyfriend asked me for oral sex. My previous roommate was a lot. She was messy and loud, but she went through a lot. I hope she is in a better place now.

I saw my girlfriend today...looking as radiant as ever. Hi Salma. Welcome back, my love. I strongly relate to the person who said they feel like a visitor. Just don't do that. People like that ruin entire semesters for others. I don't think there is a greater form of selfishness. You could do it anywhere else on earth; why a few feet away from me? By the way, are Tani and Salma still together? Asking for a friend. If you are going to have your girlfriend stay over every night, please get a single room. Some of us would like to sleep without hearing strange noises. Hats off to the class of 2025; Cupid did not miss this time around. Everyone is in a relationship.

I was exhausted from cleaning more than twice a day. Now, all her friends dislike me because I discussed a serious issue that could even lead to dangerous illnesses!

She appears clean and pretty on the outside, but I suspect she deceives you boys. Beware! I prayed to God for a new, organized, and kind roommate. God answered my prayers. She is peaceful and brings a whole new energy I never experienced at Ashesi in three years, especially from someone from a different country.

She even wakes me up when I am about to miss classes. I am not entirely used to her yet, but she makes the room feel like home. I love you, roommate.

Hint: she is a Resident Assistant in a hostel. She used to bring all sorts of local food into the room, and the smell was unbearable. I would only return at night to sleep. Her boyfriend used to visit around midnight, and they would kiss right in front of me. My innocence was violated, and they made my loneliness at Ashesi unbearable. If you have problems with your roommate, you are mature enough to address them gently. Stop hiding behind anonymity to complain.

Is this really the Class of 2025? Did Cupid forget me?  They might as well openly admit this semester is accelerated.

Mid-semester exams are, as usual, a challenge. Do other girls get jealous of their friends? I cannot wait to go home, see my dogs, my parents, and my bed. Funnily enough, I know the post-mid-semester period will be even more mentally draining, and this is a welcome distraction.  This mid-semester break is not a break because I have three assignments and two group projects to complete!

I might as well stay at school. Please stop coming to our rooms to sell clothes! If I wanted to buy something, I would contact you privately. I struggle to say no, so having you at my doorstep makes me feel obligated to buy even if I don't want to. The Ashesi mid-semester break is essentially no classes because why do I have so many submissions during the break? There is a degree only God can fix. Is it even a mid-semester break when I have papers right after the break?

Some people are allergic to certain animals and would not want to be around them, let alone eat with them nearby. There has been a cat hanging around Akornor for about two semesters now, and it seems no one is addressing the issue. I am not sure if it is the Ashesi Student Council's responsibility, but something needs to be done, seriously.  This mid-semester, can an A+ start from 40%? I am just tired. From the bottom of my heart, chewing gum feels like I have a grenade in my mouth. What is going on?  Men who do not understand that screaming and thrashing is not the only way a woman expresses that she does not want to be touched. It does not have to be rape to be non-consensual.

Right now, everywhere I go, I see girls; EmpowerHER is organizing a girls' event in November. Some of you are academically intelligent but emotionally, socially, and morally unintelligent and backward. Sapiosexuality… well understood after stepping foot in this school. Oh icks? Let me share mine.

For goodness sake, stop making people feel bad about their financial status. We get it, your father has money, but do you? Exactly. Sit down. As a guy, why should I see your boxer shorts while walking? I should only see them when you are about to sit on a dirty surface.  No entitlement here, but can those with cars during breaks allow some of us to join them? It is so difficult to get a ride out of Ashesi. Now that the exam is over and my head is clear… I just realized our potential Junior Executive Council Chairperson used a cheat sheet to answer vetting questions! Conflict of interest, right? All mid-semester breaks and Ashesi Air… it’s exhausting.

Call me weird, but I keep stalking his meal plan on that website. Like, what did you eat, babe? Bad breath. Can we start expressing our interest here? I have a crush on that dark guy from the Faculty of Information. He used to play football and goes to the gym as well. Yum, yum, yum! You are in Room 26, tall, light-skinned with pink lips. You usually wear earth tones or black. You have ""Nana"" in your name. I need you. But unfortunately, the people you hang out with are terrible Room 25 boys. Yes, that squad. So I know you are not good either. But maybe you can prove me wrong? There is this tall, dark, handsome, and funny guy in Room 27; he is in my statistics class, and I think he plays a sport, probably basketball or volleyball. I want… I need a man to rock my body.

Brown, Class of 2025, blonde braids (with those curly ends), girl squad, banging body. The girl in Room 27 with the cute face, who studies Business Administration, who is about 5'1"", sometimes wears glasses, I have a huge crush on you. Her name starts with ""A"", she's in Room 27, one of the cutest people I have ever met, walks like a model, her hostel starts with ""T"". Her smile is so pretty. I wish you were mine; I'll treat you like the angel you are. You’re the language I’m no longer fluent in. Although I still remember, please come back in 2025. A white Civic is coming for you.  A light-skinned engineering lady (in 2025)... do you have a boyfriend? Someone asked me if I liked you, and I denied it. But considering how giddy I felt looking into your eyes, how shyly I avoided your gaze, how I hid my nervousness with laughter, and how I went to bed blushing from remembering that moment, I can confidently say that I like you; in fact, I like you very much.

My plantain chips, I know you love bread. So, may I share the space that bread occupies in your heart?

There is a girl in C'26, she is pretty, used to have pink hair and now has three braids. She gives me the impression of a strong-willed girlfriend. Can we be a couple?"
Week 53,"He has a girlfriend chale , so what’s the point?😔 Met him in class for the first time, and his calm, deep voice and composure got to me, but what could I do except flush it down! Later, he came to me at the gym (was about school work), and when I turned to listen to him, the only thing I saw was his physique—the height+the chest adding up to his dark skin. Like DAMN! For a second, my 🧠 shut down that I didn’t even hear what he said😅. But heyyyy, from that day, I can’t workout in peace when I meet him at the gym… the only workout I wanna do is 👀 at him. Yet it gets harder for me to workout when he doesn’t show up coz he’s, apparently, managed to temporarily replace my “why”😭. So powerful of him.
But the guy’s so nonchalant🥲… tell me why the only thing he can say to me is Hi😭. After catching me staring at him more than 7 times (his presence has a way to suddenly steal all my attention), all he can say is Hi😭?
Extra confession: I don’t want a lot from him. I just want a lil talk (get to know each other) and his warmest hug🫂 for now. my Patooti Patooti, he’s got the AURA STEEZE COMPOSURE UP in the clouds!!🧎🏿‍♀️ She’s in 26, studying Engineering, fair, slim, and a bit tall. She mostly wears white or African prints on Fridays, and on Sundays, she wears scarf to church. I think she attends Pensa. What fascinates me most is that random smile she gives when she makes eye contact. She has a beautiful smile, and she always smells nice too.

If you see this, just know that someone notices the pain in your eyes, even when you smile the brightest. Oh, and maybe cut down your screen time, you’re always on your phone, even while eating. If only he knew how much I wanted him to bend me the f*ck over. Those boys in 25, usually in black. They’re so cute and have so much aura😍😍😍 The 26 guy that takes the donuts orders is so cute🥹 That cute girl in 27, fair and cute. Her name I think Dani....., do you have a man. When we asked our roommate why she wears her sleeping clothes to class without washing nor drying them. She said it’s because she wants to. Till this day i am spooked, a whole girl and that time she’s so pretty.😭 Not a horror story but washing in the laundry rooms at 3am would have you seeing and hearing things  The only horror story is what this boy decided to do to me. Hmmmm!!!! Need a girl like Maame in 26 in my life Most terrifying experience is that where you couldn't tell if you were sexually abused or if it hadn't gotten there yet. That feeling of dirtiness, hopelessness and not knowing what to do, who to talk to or whether you should actually say something is the most dreadful ever.  ""You can't do this in my car"" actually used to terrify and creep Ashesi girls out 💀 it's about time we addressed that man Some evenings around 3 am I could swear I hear someone screaming for their lives  Dave(26) I want you. Leave your girlfriend for me. I am willing to give you anything you want. I’ll destroy anyone who gets in my way😡🫵🏽 If you like someone... just go ahead and tell the person. You'd never know, maybe your relationship status might change, like mine! 🥹 I need a lady who can cook well in my life>> How can you tell me you're ""still learning how to cook indomie well""😭 Chaley, some of the ladies should try to help the boys resist lustful thoughts and imagination. I want to focus during my class o, but my mind revisits the reveals of your dress😩💔 Hmm I was walking from munchies to the school gate at like 12am. There was NO ONE around and it was quiet. Theree norrr I turn and see a dog tailing me. My heart dropped and I felt steam leaving my body. I think the dog felt my fear and ran. I didn’t even sack it oo. It just felt my fear😭😭 Why do I feel the article or whatever it is is biased….??? 💀😑 If the ASC wants Newton, what shows the election can't be rigged to favor him Please tell me why you decided to approach me in freshman year, when I was just minding my business, made me fall and just ghosted, like c'mon let's be real. There are better ways to begin new chapters you know. What happened to the midnight walks😫and the kisses on the forehead? I miss 'em all😭 Foine dark C’26 girl. Vibrant “model”. Mann… been craving me some more French hugs. I love  a ""books are better than the movie"" ass nigga

An ""imma intrinsically analyse this one film and then yap about it"" ass nigga 

A ""persistent Pinterest pin curator"" ass nigga 

A ""loves impressionist art"" type nigga Don't listen to your friends or people to make a decision in your relationship. They won't be there for you when things go south. Be wise. Everyone in the school are just hypocrites.  Bro where did the midsem break go??? Looking forward to spending time with my roomate again. We got closer this sem and it’s the best thing. I love you Akosua A. 😉  I’m excited for Love Inc’s Thursday services at 7pm at the Hive. Always helps me unwind and keep God at the center since it’s been difficult to do that at Ashesi Definitely not excited about seeing ashesi boys Protecting my GPA with my heart. May this semester end as fast as it started
Amen  Looking forward to my three exams🌚 Feeling good but the fact that his girlfriend is coming back 😔 no I don’t look forward to anything hope this helps 💗 Be warned. This is not second half. This is a whole other semester☠️ I actually feel anxious for the second half because  hurricane Milton can not even be compared to the force of the academic workload coming up. Chale hug any ‘25 engineering student you see around.  Hummm back to seen her without approaching her🥲 The assignments 😭😭 Can we have another week😭I don't want to do this again My eyes ache from the weight of unshed tears. School’s just gonna pile it up more and yet my glasses are so good at hiding them. maybe after the break i'll see the one   
Seeing guys shoot their shot on this form has me laughing. No wonder some girls act like they're the prize—big egos but still fragile."" 
Some people act like they’re cool until you see how they really are. The hill is full of try-hards.  ei you just broke up with your boy and you’re entertaining a new boy ei🤣","He has a girlfriend, so what is the point?  I met him in class for the first time, and his calm, deep voice and composure impressed me, but what could I do except forget about it? Later, he approached me at the gym (it was about schoolwork), and when I turned to listen, all I saw was his physique—his height and chest, accentuated by his dark skin.  Wow! For a second, my brain shut down; I didn’t even hear what he said. But hey, since that day, I cannot work out peacefully when I see him at the gym… the only exercise I want to do is look at him. Yet, it becomes harder for me to work out when he doesn’t show up because he has apparently, temporarily replaced my reason for living.  He is so powerful.

But the guy is so nonchalant. Tell me why the only thing he can say to me is “Hi”? After catching me staring at him more than seven times (his presence always captures my attention), all he can say is “Hi”?

To be honest, I don’t want much from him. I just want a little conversation (to get to know each other) and a warm hug for now.  My goodness, he has incredible aura and composure!  She is 26, studying Engineering, fair-skinned, slim, and relatively tall. She mostly wears white or African prints on Fridays, and on Sundays, she wears a headscarf to church. I think she attends Pensa. What fascinates me most is the random smile she gives when she makes eye contact. She has a beautiful smile, and she always smells nice.

If you see this, just know that someone notices the pain in your eyes, even when you smile brightly. Oh, and maybe reduce your screen time; you are always on your phone, even while eating. If only he knew how much I wanted him to make love to me. Those boys in 25, usually dressed in black, are so cute and have such an aura. The 26-year-old who takes donut orders is so cute. That cute girl in 27, fair and pretty.  I think her name is Dani… do you have a boyfriend? When we asked our roommate why she wears her pajamas to class without washing them, she said it’s because she wants to. To this day, I am shocked; she is a whole person, and she is so pretty. Not a horror story, but doing laundry at 3:00 AM in the laundry rooms would make you see and hear things. The only horror story is what this boy decided to do to me. Hmmm! I need a girl like Maame in 26 in my life. The most terrifying experience is that time I couldn't tell if I was sexually abused or not. That feeling of dirtiness, hopelessness, and not knowing what to do, who to talk to, or whether I should even say anything is the most dreadful ever.  “You can’t do this in my car” used to terrify Ashesi girls; it is about time we addressed that.

I will destroy anyone who gets in my way. If you like someone, just tell them. You never know; maybe your relationship status might change, like mine! I need a woman who can cook well in my life. How can you tell me you are “still learning how to cook Indomie well”?  Some of the ladies should try to help the boys resist lustful thoughts and imaginations. I want to focus during my class, but my mind keeps replaying the revealing nature of your dress. I was walking from Munchies to the school gate at about 12:00 AM. There was no one around, and it was quiet. Then I turned and saw a dog following me. My heart dropped, and I felt myself getting scared. I think the dog felt my fear and ran. I didn’t even chase it. It just felt my fear. Why do I feel this article or whatever it is is biased? If the ASC wants Newton, what proves the election cannot be rigged in his favor? Please tell me why you decided to approach me in freshman year, when I was just minding my business, made me fall for you, and then ghosted me. There are better ways to start new chapters, you know. What happened to the midnight walks and the kisses on the forehead? I miss them all. Fine, dark girl in C26. Vibrant “model.”  Man… I have been craving more hugs. I love a “books are better than the movie” type of guy. An “I’m intrinsically going to analyze this one film and then talk about it” type of guy. A “persistent Pinterest pin curator” type of guy. A “loves Impressionist art” type of guy. Do not listen to your friends or other people to make decisions in your relationship. They will not be there for you when things go wrong. Be wise. Everyone in school is just a hypocrite. Bro, where did the mid-semester break go? Looking forward to spending time with my roommate again. We got closer this semester, and it’s the best thing. I love you, Akosua A. I am excited for Love Inc.’s Thursday services at 7:00 PM at the Hive. It always helps me relax and keep God at the center of my life, since it’s been difficult to do that at Ashesi. Definitely not excited about seeing Ashesi boys “protecting.” I am struggling with my Grade Point Average.  May this semester end quickly. Amen. I am looking forward to my three examinations. I feel good, but the fact that his girlfriend is returning is upsetting.  No, I do not look forward to anything. I hope this helps. Be warned: this is not the second half of the semester; this is a completely new semester. I actually feel anxious about the second half because Hurricane Milton is nothing compared to the upcoming academic workload. Friend, give any 2025 engineering student you see a hug.  Hmm, back to seeing her without approaching her. The assignments! Can we have another week? I do not want to do this again. My eyes ache from unshed tears. School will only increase my stress, and yet my glasses are good at hiding them. Maybe after the break, I will see the one.

Seeing guys make romantic advances on this form is making me laugh. No wonder some girls act like they are prizes—big egos but still fragile. Some people act cool until you see their true selves. The hill is full of people trying too hard.  Hey, you just broke up with your boyfriend and you are entertaining a new boy!"
Week 54,"EmpowerHer should cook something for us😭. We’ve been starved😭😭 I pray you stub your toe on the sharpest corner of the wall. And I pray your laptop gets spoilt a week to exams. And I pray you fall down at the archer courtyard during academic break or wellness Wednesday. My gone but never leaving love,

May karma never find you, coz the way you’d suffer, herh🌝

I hope you find another one, but much better than me, coz at least I’d feel like you were worth reducing my standards for!

My love for you never dies, but it don’t matter.

Now I’m deeply falling for one of your friends, and I hope you never get between us. What you’ve cost me is enough, boy🥹. Don’t you take away my other love of my life. You were the first, my before, but I deserve a happy after😭. God will punish you  Hey Ex😎, I have missed you😂. I have forgotten the past and that’s how soft I am🥹. But I want to teach you a lesson because I have not forgotten the emotional torture🥺. My plan is to date you again and this time around, make you fall hard for me, then on my birthday 🎉 I break up with you😂. I love you though🥰. WARNING ⚠️ watch out and be careful 😎
 To my beautiful and amazing friends, and my even more amazing boyfriend, I love you all to bits and I don’t know what I would do or how I would navigate this school without you all! May God bless and keep you all His new girl is hot and beautiful asf so happy for him( friend of an ex)  She still checks my IG and socials to see how I’m doing. B*tch! I’m winning. To that one boy...

I found some old maps we drew, but the paths don’t lead anywhere anymore. Just a reminder that the treasure hunt turned into a maze, and I’m tired of getting lost. Keep your compass; I’m charting a new course.   You’ve mastered the art of ghosting while pretending to be a ghost yourself. It’s impressive how you can act like everything’s fine when you’re really just a coward. Hope your new life is as empty as your promises. That light skin girl with the hard fit in ‘26 I need her baddddd GIMMIEE GIMIIE 😛 we don’t talk about kingsford  Where was Adam, Mouctar, Generaly, Jacob. Willy was clearly tired but they can’t sub him out💔😂😂 but they sub Mumuni for overlapping. God save the school team. I don’t think the volleyball people should put up the net again. Always inconveniencing us futsal players and then going ahead to embarrass us like that🚮 Was the Ashesi coach playing favorites? I don’t want to mention names but some of the people he played were very questionable considering there were some much better players on the bench That goalkeeper is single-handedly responsible for our loss ACity center halves 🤌.
NB: Can't win all the time. Sometimes you are good Sometimes you are bad. Next time take the chances(score from the set pieces) Our support system (ashesi) is very disappointing to say the least. I mean come on guys. The crazy part is that when you're cheering for the team people be looking at you like you're crazy. Social cohesion my foot! Anyways congrats to the Basketball guys. Football lads another day it will workout innit  That academic city commentator(female) was just talking straight up SMACK like shut upp😭😭ah she was just dissing our team. Sooo unprofessional. Such a pick me girl mtchewww get a life That goal keeper eh. He probably has a girl in Academic city ✋🏾 because eiii. He’s the reason we lost. How aren’t you in the goal postttt. And for the penalty, he was just there like 🧍🏾‍♂️Ei not even a leg tilt I don’t get why we allowed that white individual from Acity to talk trash on the mic while she was in our home. Like tf. But she to she is very Jon  To the Ashesi football team, 👏  Ice and the team, I take my hat off to you guys. Adom my eyes are still watching 👀  How can we lose to ACITY so embarrassing  Someone please explain the connection between Twi and noise because l don't understand why some people just become so loud when they start speaking in Twi.","EmpowerHer should prepare a meal for us. We are very hungry. I hope you stub your toe on the sharpest corner of a wall. I hope your laptop malfunctions a week before your exams. I hope you fall in the Archer Courtyard during the academic break or Wellness Wednesday. My past love,

May karma never touch you, because the suffering you would endure would be immense.

I hope you find someone better than me, so that I can feel like you were worth lowering my standards for!

My love for you will never die, but it does not matter.

I am now deeply in love with one of your friends, and I hope you will not interfere. You have caused me enough pain; do not take away my other love. You were my first love, but I deserve happiness. God will punish you. Hey, Ex, I have missed you. I have forgiven the past; that is how forgiving I am. But I want to teach you a lesson because I have not forgotten the emotional pain you caused me. My plan is to date you again, make you fall hard for me, and then break up with you on my birthday. I love you, though. WARNING: Be careful.

Ashesi students: Lecturer, I want to say it in my own words😭ah Those tall dark A City boys though 😍 The Maame Dankwa girl can take all my money🙏🏾 Another day to see people who deserve awards lose them because of votes and popularity. ASC fix it wai, have better criteria than votes only.  i decided to say “okay” for a change. Okay to the boys who keep buzzing me for talking stages and whatnots; and girl let me see - he was caught off guard, fumbling, speechless and you know that glimpse or scent of fear and insecurity in a man’s eyes? I saw it, growing rapidly almost engulfing that young lad, maybe let’s start saying “okay” or “yes” for a change, i’m still waiting for him to gather himself 😂; tsw  um, it’s not it THIS YEAR I honestly don't feel like going because my crush rejected my invitation to Ubora. I don't plan on going with anyone but her, let alone myself. This Ashesi community is embarrassing to say the least. Acity came here and it felt like they were playing a home game. Where was the crowd? Where was the support? Guys, ask that girl you’ve been eyeing to be your date!! This might be your chance. 
Bring back old romance!!  Can we make #Uboraposals a thing pleaseeeee
Like promposals but for Ubora🥹 Ashesi sports culture is dead Please let’s be guided with this ubora thingy.😔 No come pressure us ooo.  Let’s talk about maturity !! A lot of Ashesi students lack that and it shows in their mannerisms- especially boys 💀 Talk about why classism is a real thing in Ghana- especially in Ashesi and how respecting people regardless their backgrounds should matter more than their class- “As you go up, you will meet people coming down; as you come down, you will meet people going up.”- life can surprise you and turn the tables. Ashesi students dey see demma body pass. Make some noise then everybody just dey there. If you're won't show some support why bother coming in the first place. PLEASE IF YOU'RE NOT COMING TO SUPPORT YOUR COLLEAGUES, DO NOT COME! What's the point of proudly saying that I am from Ashesi if our students don't support each other in front of strangers 🥲 Chale you know she has a boyfriend but you're asking her to Ubora? Some of you set yourselves up Uboraposals🥹❤️ Bring back Tanko parties. if you see an Entrepreneurship student, hug them and give them 2 billion wai😭 How are we going to be sure that the new ASC heads will reduce lateness in events? Because it is critical oo
 is the reading still tomorrow? haven’t heard any communication from the asc after the posted the schedule MIPS assembly language? kwerh. didn’t understand anything. anyways I’ve already put it on my cv after the first lesson I might look fine but deep down I know something suspicious is going on behind these elections😒.

DON'T DO IT Kiss your male best friend  Guy there's this one FI eh, just let me graduate first. He'll be mine All that violence from Maritime so unnecessary cause ah???? Are you really coming to fight because you can't play well and it's showing? Like please find somewhere to sit, it's embarrassing for you. They can have the trophyless win since they want it so bad. Please next time Acity should be the only school allowed on our campus 🙏🏾 I don’t know who handpicked the other ones 🙄 Lock pfungwa up and keep her somewhere safe. Shout out to the little ball boys! Watching them help out and run after balls during football games makes me smile, God bless them. Ashesi school teams and winning🫲🫱 So why were the Maritime boys fighting? Was all of that really necessary? It was fun to watch though so I'm not complaining. I love the love Ashesi students have for their Campus to go to that extent, Man 😅😭🤣🤣. Anyways, I really enjoyed yesterday's Bb's game. Go go Sugri, Sean, Trueman, we are proud 🥰 The acity’s pen was too soft🦦 Who the hell designed the pictures for the UBORA nominees?

Week 56,"How can you give the (Ashesi)guys medals and leave the ladies who won? Is the Sportscom serious? Just as the guys invest time and energy into football trainings so do the girls, stop making fun of women’s football( before I start mentioning names😡😠).. The games were nice hey, especially basketball , oh i even met my soulmate from Maritime 😍 so fine. Glad i came to watch.❤️🥰 Those that start saying hello to us because they want votes?? Wtf?? So unethical. I will vote for you because you deserve it not because you greeted me. Be for real. The A-City boys tho😋😋 VOTE FOR ARTHURRRR!!!
(Whatever category, if you see Arthur just VOTEEEE) Player for player Ashesi>> Academic but match performance Acity >> Ashesi  Another stellar performance from Acity. Well deserved win. Solid back line including Jamal the Goalkeeper  Deep down I feel if we played Maritime in the final we would have lost😕 From coach to bench warmer 👌
Glazing Acity at the moment  Huge respect to center back Soke🙌🙌. He missed a tackle and gave a penalty in the early minutes and as captain he didn't let his guard down. He appeared more resilent and stronger in the air and on ground till the end and despite the penalty miss in the shootout. I respect him for giving his all.
Bro to bro I wish Ashesi boys had the same passion and didnt rely on vibes and complacency  Sportsman of the Year, they should give am to that nigérien guy Harouna..the guy did a fantastic job in sports this year. Kiss whoever you want to kiss. Think about consequences later. She hates herself so much and it simply doesn't make sense to me. She's the kindest, smartest, most beautiful girl I've ever met. I really wish she could see herself the way I see her. She'd love herself so much if she did. Dave and Elikem should be the only ones there for Tech Wiz! Which other pretenders are those? If Daniel is going to mention the Career Fair competition win, Elikem and Dave won that in their very first year in Ashesi, so big deal. Most importantly, they know how to have fun Yes it’s been a long time since we broke up,
Yes it’s embarrassing I can’t move on,
Yes I wish we worked out and I didn’t have to love from far.
But in all, I pray I find life again. I’m only joyed I am the half of the tale that goes through this while the other is free with a life again. I hope the ink posts this and I hope my ex sees this.
The cost of us has been paid with my repute. With the finishing of every letter grade on my transcript. Maybe truly fate was to blame Your recent post said that boys should stop acting like football is all about them and learn from the girls. I mean sorry, the girls didn't get medals when they deserved them, but what do you mean learn from the girls?💀 There is nothing on a football pitch that a girl in this school can teach any boy. Even your best player would be bullied by the worst bunch of random Engineering boys in this school. I've been here for 3 years, I know what I'm saying. If you watch Juliann well, she actually deserves every category she is in right now, that girl can JUGGLE a lottt  I’m so glad I met these 2  men, life suddenly makes sense. One is Jesus lol.  This girl broke my heart fr, we were literally sisters and she ruined it and I don’t think she even cares, lol. Girls can be weird.  Bring back UT cab! That’s the only way I made it for my 8ams in first year and second year i used to go to class. in third year now, i go to lectures. i see the difference now Star Image? It's gotta be our shortie, vote Hilary guys 😂 If I had a cedi for every time there's been a comment about Elikem's hair on the Ink, I'd have 2 cedis, and one of those would be bright pink 😂  You better stop filtering this shit The Weather outside is Rizzy
But the fire is so skibidi
And since I've gyatt to go
Ohio Ohio ohio  Half of you girls want to be approached, with your faces looking like koobi Where is Ozeba? I SAID AMAPIANO WOULD DIE! WHY ARE CLASSROOMS SO COLD😭I can’t even pay attention to the lecture without freezing my brain Shoutout to vigilante 
Tell us more… Vigilante is causing chaos 😂 And all of a sudden, Akornor is trying to improve their services  Wouldn’t have bought the doughnuts on Saturday if it wasn’t for that one girl Can we have the game ""Ashesi women's team vs. Engineering boys"" that the so-called sexist talked about? Petty boy..lol  Please we want to see what's on the paper🥹 Little Missy be talking about aura and steeze basically all the time but simple flushing the toilet and leaving it clean for the next person she can't do😒🚮 We love Hallmark but the waiting time is insane 😭😭.  They need to do a one on the screening process to become an FI, because some of them do not even want to be here fr  You pay 170 for jerseys and two months into the semester they are yet to be delivered. You ask around and no one gives you a straight answer. AFA style up ☹️  Hallmark’s jollof couldn’t beat our beloved “Big Ben”😭😭.. The jollof was great! Thank you SLE💕. Hope they don’t change. And I think with time they will coordinate better to reduce the waiting time. It’s a fresh start, let’s have patience 🫶 Where the huzz at? I've bought only fried rice from them, and it was actually pretty good and a lot, but the wait time was way too long, I guess they're still figuring out their rhythm. 
 Joseph Adjei should be sacked. He is not fit to be a lecturer in Ashesi. Lacks communication and leadership skills for a school that champions such values If you're coming to give me a quarter of a plate of rice, do it with your chest and stop giving me vegetables I didn't ask for to make it look like you're not They should worry about the stress and confusion. They’ll get used to it. I just hope they maintain their quality. Also they have to scale down their menu😭😭😭. I hope everything works out well Suspect needs a new roommate. Am I blind or is that Micah twice? You guys I can't pretend anymore I'm hurttttt😭😭 and she's so perfect, it makes sense he would pick her over me. I would pick her too.
""She's so pretty, she just sorta sparkles. I'll never sparkle"" I don't understand why we are being so stingy with the ubora pictures???  Some girls are just ugh. Your boy will come and talk trash about other girls to you and you’ll start to hate the girl because of what your boy said. 98% of the time, the boy is just a liar and couldn’t get the girl. Let’s be guided girls. We’re all we have.  Tired. But I'm into it. Christmas is almost here. That's all that matters Suspect’s been going to classes for the whole semester but only trusting God to help answer every task assigned. Suspect must switch courses, what is this? Or rather switch schools.🙂‍↕️ Do you love me back? Please why is Hallmark making us pay 5 cedis for a small paper cup? What was the egg doing inside the rice ball 😭🤧😂💔 Yes, I love you back. Chale you'll seriously be thinking about your COA exam on Tuesday and be seeing heartbroken people on the Ink. Everybody and their problem wai","How can you award medals to the Ashesi male football players and exclude the female winners? Is the Sports Committee being serious?  Just as the men dedicate time and effort to football training, so do the women. Stop trivializing women's football (before I start naming names😡😠). The games were enjoyable, especially the basketball. I even met my soulmate from the Maritime University 😍—so handsome. I'm glad I came to watch. ❤️🥰 Those who suddenly become friendly because they want votes?  What the…? That's unethical. I will vote for you because you deserve it, not because you greeted me. Be genuine.  The A-City boys though 😋😋 VOTE FOR ARTHUR!!! (Regardless of the category, if you see Arthur, just VOTE). Player for player, Ashesi is better academically, but A-City's match performance surpasses Ashesi's. Another excellent performance from A-City. A well-deserved win. Solid back line, including Jamal the goalkeeper. Deep down, I feel we would have lost to Maritime in the final😕. From coach to bench warmer 👌. I am incredibly impressed with A-City's performance. Huge respect to center back Soke 🙌🙌. He made a tackle mistake, resulting in a penalty in the early minutes, but as captain, he did not let his guard down. He displayed greater resilience and strength in the air and on the ground until the end, despite the penalty miss in the shootout. I respect him for giving his all. Honestly, I wish the Ashesi men had the same passion and did not rely on hype and complacency.  Sportsman of the Year should go to that Nigerian guy, Harouna… the guy did a fantastic job in sports this year. Kiss whoever you want to kiss. Think about the consequences later. She hates herself so much, and it simply does not make sense to me. She is the kindest, smartest, most beautiful girl I have ever met. I really wish she could see herself the way I see her. She would love herself so much if she did. Dave and Elikem should be the only ones considered for Tech Wiz! Who are these other pretenders? If Daniel is going to mention the Career Fair competition win, Elikem and Dave won that in their very first year at Ashesi, so it is not a big deal. Most importantly, they know how to have fun. Yes, it has been a long time since we broke up, yes, it is embarrassing that I cannot move on, yes, I wish we had worked out and I did not have to love from afar. But overall, I pray I find life again. I am only glad that I am the half of the story that goes through this while the other is free with a life again. I hope the Ink posts this, and I hope my ex sees this. The cost of our relationship has been paid with my reputation. With the completion of every letter grade on my transcript. Maybe truly fate was to blame. Your recent post said that boys should stop acting like football is all about them and learn from the girls. I mean, sorry, the girls did not get medals when they deserved them, but what do you mean learn from the girls? 💀 There is nothing on a football pitch that a girl in this school can teach any boy. Even your best player would be bullied by the worst group of random Engineering boys in this school. I have been here for three years; I know what I am saying. If you watch Juliann well, she actually deserves every category she is in right now; that girl can juggle a lot. I am so glad I met these two men; life suddenly makes sense. One is Jesus lol. This girl broke my heart for real; we were literally sisters, and she ruined it, and I do not think she even cares, lol. Girls can be weird. Bring back the UT cab! That's the only way I made it to my 8 a.m. classes in my first and second years.  Now in my third year, I go to lectures. I see the difference now. Star Image? It has to be our shortie, vote Hilary guys 😂. If I had a cedi for every time there has been a comment about Elikem's hair on the Ink, I would have two cedis, and one of those would be bright pink 😂.

They need to improve the screening process to become a Food and Beverage (FI) staff member because some of them do not even want to be here for real. You pay 170 cedis for jerseys, and two months into the semester they are yet to be delivered. You ask around, and no one gives you a straight answer. Ashesi Faculty Association (AFA) style up ☹️. Hallmark's jollof could not beat our beloved ""Big Ben""😭😭… The jollof was great! Thank you SLE💕. I hope they do not change. And I think… With time, they will coordinate better to reduce the waiting time. It is a fresh start; let us be patient. Where is the excitement? I have only bought fried rice from them, and it was actually quite good and plentiful, but the waiting time was excessively long. I suppose they are still finding their rhythm.  Joseph Adjei should be dismissed. He is unfit to be a lecturer at Ashesi University. He lacks the communication and leadership skills expected of a school that champions such values. If you are giving me a quarter plate of rice, do it confidently and stop adding vegetables I did not request to make it seem like you are giving more. They should be concerned about the stress and confusion. They will get accustomed to it. I just hope they maintain their quality. Also, they need to reduce their menu offerings. I hope everything works out well.  Suspect needs a new roommate. Am I mistaken, or is that Micah twice? You guys, I cannot pretend any longer; I am hurt, and she is so perfect; it makes sense that he would choose her over me. I would too.

She is so pretty; she just seems to radiate. I will never radiate like that. I do not understand why we are being so stingy with the Ubora pictures. Some girls are just unpleasant. Your boyfriend will come and speak badly about other girls to you, and you will start to dislike the girl because of what your boyfriend said. Ninety-eight percent of the time, the boyfriend is simply lying and could not get the girl. Let us be wise, girls. We are all we have. I am tired, but I am enjoying it. Christmas is almost here. That is all that matters. Suspect has been attending classes all semester but is only relying on God to help answer every assignment. Suspect must change courses; what is this? Or rather, change schools. Do you love me back?  Why is Hallmark making us pay five cedis for a small paper cup? What was the egg doing inside the rice ball? Yes, I love you back. Friend, you will seriously be thinking about your COA exam on Tuesday and see heartbroken people on Instagram. Everyone and their problems."
Week 57,"Suspect is toxic  Suspect is addicted to his close friend. Their relationship is now complicated. He might be in love with her Go back to 10 slide posts Suspect is lowkey into her gender but she has a man😂 suspect is gay Suspect has a crush on a boy who wouldn't look at her twice Suspect still believes she’ll find true love in this Ashesi Suspect can’t wait to graduate  Suspect wants to go on a baecation but she ignores all the guys in her dm🥲 Pathetic to see smart Ashesi students only do assignments and learn for quizzes. We only get to discuss assignments and next submissions. No life, no passion discovery, no skill development. Didn't expect this as a freshman. Was Ashesi all hype? Did I make a mistake?  I just confirmed empty barrels do make the most noise! That C26 Nhyiraba girl doesn’t know anything but always wants to make decisions for people. Bro!!!!!!!! I'm with her right now, and we're both silently using our phones. Where did it all go wrong? suspect is always late to class  Suspect will not join the boba tea craze 🙏🏾 hallmark it’s been less than a week and you’ve reduced the sizes of you’re crepes ?you’ll pay for your crimes 🫵🏾 Shorty so thick she like a hardware and systems fundamentals exam paper We didn't last long. 
Unexpectedly, like a storm appearing in the middle of clear sky 
With no build up 
No foreshadowing 
You called it off 

It hurt ngl
But on second thought, in those few days I was really happy
So... thanks for that
I guess if I was going to be with someone for a few days, 
I'm glad it was you. 
Have a nice life! Linkin Park songs are speaking to me on a deeply spiritual level Suspect is looking for the huzz At least you get to silently be with her on your phone. We don't hang out anymore, I feel like I've lost my best friend He’s in 26. He does M.E. He’s not Ghanaian, he spoke to me once and his accent gave me chills. He always has some strict look on his face so I don’t even know how to go talk to him. Shout out to him!! Ashesi is way too censored Shoutout to Kirk🔥 Shoutout to my mannn🥹😆. He’s intelligent, creative, handsome, caring, sweet. He’s hardworking and he doesn’t give himself enough credit.

Thank you for making my day a little brighter
 Hiiiii Blay, ‘26. I admire your hardwork and how cordial you are. Just want to say , you are doing great!   Special special shootout to Najeeb ans Salim. Idk how I would have made it through the semester 😭😭😭😭 Ashesi should give Salim a raise 🥺❤️ Shootout to Tan Tan. You're the best est!!!! Tani deserves all the bread at Hakuna🫶 Men don’t really deserve a day cl 🤷🏾‍♀️ Bernard AGBLOE🍆 Boys aren't appreciated enough.   Chale, shout out to my two favorite dudes in this campus. Elkan and Kwame AK. Never fail to brighten my mood. ❤️❤️ Precious enough to defile, but not precious enough to handle with care. Sometimes I think men see something pretty, and have to break it. Maybe it was his nature, and not his choice To all beautiful and handsome men, we cherish you our ribs🥰.
Girls all men are not the same 🌚 Shoutout to my favorite Jomens He asked me to buy him something at essentials and I said “let me see what I can do” ✌🏾.  To the guy I met at fab lab x03, please try being a bit nicer to people, okay? I gave him an attitude cause he got upset with me for something I did to him.
#Womeninsassymalefields You are literally the only boy I talk to! When he asks me to post him on my Instagram story but ''I don't even use Instagram like that'' 🤷🏾‍♀️ He only ever saw me as a friend. I told him  I was okay with just being friends.Long story short. I ended up ruining the friendship.
#Womeninmalefields When he catches me with my bestfriend, so I tell him ''believe what you want'' He ended up venting to me in a text and I replied with ‘I’m just a chill girl, type shit’ When he ask ''what are we?'' and I reply with ''do we have to put a label on it? #womeninmalefields When I tell him I don't want to put a label on it, because label ruins things  I accidentally cheated on him and had to beg him to take me back with tears in my eyes. I missed my grandmother who died when I was 6.  First time my bestie introduced him to the friend group we told him she’s never felt like this before and we’ve never seen her happier. 2 weeks later we were saying same to her crush.  He said he used to play football in highschool so I asked him to name the Real Madrid XI from 2016.  Saw him at the gym doing a deadlift so I went to hold it for him and suggested he remove some weight lest he gets hurt. Saving the Ashesi community 🙏🏾.  I cheated and sent him a text that starts with “it hurts me more than it hurts you.” When he wants to bring up something I did so I tell him that women like peace in a relationship, you may be handsome but if you’re not respectful and you’re not my peace 🕊️, it’s a difficult for all involved.  The time I lied to him that I loved him so  I could sleep with him #staytoxic The girl with the blanket ......... hw far? I called him dramatic when he expressed how he felt 😎 He said he couldn’t be loyal, so I let him go. Now he’s out here auditioning for a role that’s been recast. #WomanInAMansField""
 My relationship🙏🏽 Attrams 🙌🏾 that nigga won’t sacrifice an opportunity to put his friends on… more creatives should be like that When he asks what his role is in the programming project and I tell him to proofread the final report

#WomenInMaleFields I knew he liked me but as far as I’m concerned I don’t so he can be there🙂 You know what would increase engagement? IF THINGS STARTED ON FUCKING TIME
FOR FUCKS SAKE  Being asked to explain something and then refusing to because they’re a boy and they just won’t get it.  To the guys that are bleeding in Ashesi, we dey for you. The temperature that some people put the AC on is so inconsiderate. If you are cold when it's on 26, go and sit outside. Don't come and put the AC on 31 as if you just stepped out of a frozen lake.  Rigging ustun then rigging ubora, that’s bs  I thought my ***** would be there, I got tickets for my friends and I, and he wasn’t there. He’s the M.E guy in 26 from the last time🥲 I think it's unfair to tell us to audition...tell some of us we can't perform because there are limited spots,then make some of your friends who didn't audition come and perform... Why is everything looking forced 😭😭 Pleasee we beg. Bring Blacko for the next Asc week. nahhh the second set of Macs ATEEEEEEE Nah the second set of MCs ATEEEEEEEEEE single people have failed to breathe yet again😪 Last years own was better in terms of everything . The red light at this one was too much ei. As if we're going for rituals Johanna's voice was so sweet OMG I go start learning French too. This song was amazing 😍 Noo dis one here, know say dis might not reach am but chale, dat international girl in red kill am die! Lowkey, she's a GOAT The most boring event I have been too tbh. Next time should be better and more engaging  The seating was not done properly..we stood the door for a while before anyone bothered to  seat us 😪 Mina minks? Deserved fr(anyways book her she can do it for you)  Kimberly's look was🤩😍👌 Can't tell him in person, but he absolutely A-T-E it! He's in C'25 doing CS. Kimberly Taj was robbed of the female best dressed award ngl  We hadn’t sat down for even up to 10 minutes since the event started and they were already announcing awardees. No build up, no anticipation. It was giving  “announcements” but everyone played dress up  This semester things cast oh I once got stuck in the bathroom while my roommate and his girlfriend were seriously going at it I listen, and I will judge all of you one by one I step on the cat's tail anytime I'm the only one around it

We listen, we don't judge Anytime the UBORA nominees came to solicit for votes, I lied that I had already voted for them


We listen, we don't judge, because we all did it I used to have sex with my roommates girlfriend  Had rltnships with 3 guys last year, then decided to stop dating for new year resolutions. Right now, I have a crush on my ex’s close friend and tryna make things work out with us. Mind you I just broke up with another guy we started dating earlier this year. Besides, I’m crushing on every calm, tall guy I meet, including my FIs. We hear, we don’t judge, but we help a mate😭","The suspect is emotionally volatile and obsessed with a close friend. Their relationship is complex, possibly romantic on the suspect's part.  Review previous ten social media posts. The suspect is subtly interested in the friend's gender but the friend is in a relationship. The suspect is gay. The suspect has a crush on a boy who is uninterested. The suspect believes they will find love at Ashesi University. The suspect is eager to graduate. The suspect desires a romantic getaway but ignores messages from potential suitors. It's disheartening to see intelligent Ashesi students solely focused on academics, lacking personal growth and exploration. This was unexpected as a freshman. Was Ashesi all it was hyped up to be? Did I make a mistake? I've learned that those who boast the loudest often know the least. That C26 Nhyiraba girl is uninformed yet constantly tries to control others.  Goodness! I am currently with her, and we are both silently using our phones. How did things go so wrong? The suspect is consistently late to class. The suspect will not participate in the boba tea trend. Hallmark, you reduced the size of your crepes after less than a week? You will face consequences. That girl is exceptionally curvy. Our relationship was short-lived. Unexpectedly, like a sudden storm, you ended things. There was no warning, no indication. It hurt, honestly. But looking back, I was genuinely happy during those few days. So, thank you for that. If I was going to be with someone for a short time, I'm glad it was you. Have a good life! Linkin Park's music resonates with me on a profound level. The suspect is searching for romance. At least you can quietly spend time with her using your phone. We no longer spend time together; I feel as though I've lost my best friend. He is in year 26. He studies Mechanical Engineering. He is not Ghanaian; his accent was striking. He always appears serious, making it difficult to approach him. Kudos to him! Ashesi is excessively restrictive. Shout out to Kirk! Shout out to my man! He is intelligent, creative, handsome, caring, and kind. He is hardworking but doesn't give himself enough credit. I deeply appreciate you, and you inspire me daily. I love you.  Shout out to David Effah in the SLE office; he is the best. Shout out to the fabulous Eugene Takyi-Micah. Shout out to Naren. Augustus Kofi Gaisie is always exciting. Thank God for him. Augustus enjoys all the good things. Tello Nelson has been providing free food. Shout out to faithful boyfriends and everyone else! Everyone deserves recognition. To the beautiful CE 25 girl with glasses, he does not appreciate you and does not deserve you. You deserve much better. Thanks to Bright and his friends for helping us with our hunger last night.  Myself, because I am him. Shout out to my best friend whom I sometimes kiss. Kwame Afriyie Buabeng (Bonah), class of 2025, is who he believes himself to be. Philip Quartey, class of 2027, is the best ever! Is Welile Chilly single? He has a great sense of humor, plays sports, and is very funny. To that one guy in '25 who always greets me, thank you for brightening my day. Hi Blay, '26. I admire your hard work and friendly nature. You're doing great!  A massive thank you to Najeeb and Salim. I wouldn't have made it through the semester without you. Ashesi should give Salim a raise. Shout out to Tan Tan; you're the best! Tan deserves all the good things at Hakuna. Men don't really deserve a special day. Bernard AGBLOE. Boys aren't appreciated enough.  Friend, shout out to my two favorite guys on campus, Elkan and Kwame AK.  You always brighten my mood.  Precious enough to be desired, but not precious enough to be treated gently. Sometimes I think men see something beautiful and feel compelled to break it. Perhaps it's their nature, not their choice. To all beautiful and handsome men, we cherish you.  Girls, not all men are the same. Shout out to my favorite men. He asked me to buy him something, and I said, ""Let me see what I can do."" To the guy I met at the Fab Lab X03, please try to be kinder to people. I responded defensively because he was upset with me for something I did. #WomenInSassyMaleFields You are literally the only boy I speak to! When he asked me to post him on my Instagram story, but “I don't even use Instagram like that.” He only ever saw me as a friend. I told him I was fine with just being friends.  Long story short, I ruined the friendship.  #WomenInMaleFields When he caught me with my best friend, I told him, ""Believe what you want."" He vented to me via text, and I replied, ""I'm just a chill girl, type of thing."" When he asked, ""What are we?"" I replied, ""Do we need a label?"" #WomenInMaleFields When I said I didn't want to label it because labels ruin things…I accidentally cheated on him and had to beg for forgiveness. It brought me back to a time when I cried for my grandmother, who passed away when I was six years old.  My best friend first introduced my boyfriend to our friend group; we told him that she had never felt this way before and that we had never seen her happier. Two weeks later, we were saying the same thing about her crush. He mentioned he played football in high school, so I asked him to name the Real Madrid starting eleven from 2016. I saw him at the gym doing a deadlift, so I went to help him hold the weight and suggested he reduce the weight to avoid injury. Saving the Ashesi community. I cheated and sent him a text that began, ""This hurts me more than it hurts you."" When he tries to bring up something I did, I tell him that women value peace in a relationship; you may be handsome, but if you are not respectful and you are not my peace, it is difficult for everyone involved. I lied to him that I loved him so I could sleep with him. The girl with the blanket...how far has she gotten? I called him dramatic when he expressed his feelings. He said he couldn't be loyal, so I let him go. Now he is auditioning for a role that has already been filled.  My relationship. That guy will not miss an opportunity to help his friends; more creative people should be like that. When he asks what his role is in the programming project, I tell him to proofread the final report. I knew he liked me, but as far as I am concerned, I did not, so he can be there. You know what would increase engagement? If things started on time! Being asked to explain something and then refusing to because they are a boy and they just won't get it. To the guys who are unwell at Ashesi, we are here for you. The temperature some people set the air conditioning to is inconsiderate. If you are cold when it is set to 26 degrees, go and sit outside. Do not set the air conditioning to 31 degrees as if you just came from a frozen lake. Rigging the Ustun and then rigging the Ubora—that is nonsense. I thought my boyfriend would be there; I got tickets for my friends and me, and he was not there. He was the M.E. guy in C26 from last time. I think it is unfair to tell us to audition, tell some of us we cannot perform because there are limited spots, then let some of your friends who did not audition come and perform. Why is everything looking forced? Please, we beg. Bring Blacko for the next Asc week.  The second set of MCs were amazing! Single people have failed to breathe again. Last year's event was better in every aspect. The red lighting at this event was excessive. It was as if we were attending a ritual. Johanna's voice was so sweet; I will start learning French too. That song was amazing! This one here, I know this might not reach him, but that international girl in red absolutely killed it! Low-key, she's a GOAT. The most boring event I have been to, to be honest. Next time should be better and more engaging. The seating was not done properly; we stood by the door for a while before anyone bothered to seat us. Mina Minks? Deserved it (anyway, book her; she can do it for you). Kimberly's look was amazing. I cannot tell him in person, but he absolutely excelled! He is in C25 doing Computer Science. Kimberly Taj was robbed of the female best-dressed award. We had not been sitting for even ten minutes since the event started and they were already announcing awardees. No buildup, no anticipation. It felt like announcements, but everyone dressed up. This semester's events are a mess. I once got stuck in the bathroom while my roommate and his girlfriend were having sex. I listen, and I will judge all of you one by one. I step on the cat's tail anytime I'm the only one around it. We listen, we do not judge. Anytime the UBORA nominees came to solicit votes, I lied that I had already voted for them. We listen, we do not judge, because we all did it. I used to have sex with my roommate's girlfriend. I had relationships with three guys last year, then decided to stop dating for New Year's resolutions. Right now, I have a crush on my ex's close friend and am trying to make things work out with him. Mind you, I just broke up with another guy we started dating earlier this year. Besides, I am crushing on every calm, tall guy I meet, including my FIs. We hear, we do not judge, but we help a friend."
Week 58,"She keeps coming to class ready to party at the club and when he said are we going to party together....👎👎 It's good that you've found God now o , but I won't forget what a hoe you were literally last year. Suspect is a male, mechanical engineering 2025 After WOC, I've never written any essay myself I wanna know the thought process behind sitting directly under an AC and complaining about being cold💀 How about we stop putting ACs above room temperature...30 degrees is diabolical for an air conditioner we're not tryna warm ourselves here girl☹️ Semester over, let's pack our things and go home I think the funniest thing on campus rn is how hard Akornor is trying. 
Acting like a typical man-always giving the bare minimum until they notice there’s competition  Review the winners of each award. Did they do enough to warrant their award? Exhausted. 
November/December death ain't cool, right?
January maybe? After the festive season? Talk to that girl  Don't prioritse people who don't prioritse you. If they find another person or group more fun to hang out with, never get to the point of begging them to spend time with you. Please respect yourself and move on. You deserve better! Leave.  Why did you leave God to try and handle it all alone ? STAY AWAY FROM THAT BOY PLEASEEEE Put more effort into your academics and make more friends who’ll help you grow better  Sleep wai. You can learn all night and still not even get a B😭😭😭 Who advices these C’27 boys to braid😭 Mind your business always 🙉🙉 Chale just sleep. Whatever will happen will happen. Whether you stay up all night studying or learn literally an hour to time, you'll get the same mark, I promise you I would tell her not to crush on every cute boy with she sees🙂 You won't end up with any of them sweetie It gets betterrrrrr They'll say you’ll be fine, don’t listen  You for mow oo Calm down!
You have four years bro, not one month Don’t take things personal. Work on yourself and take little steps everyday to get the results you desire. Atomic habits count. Learn to let go and don’t hold grudges, better to be free than to hold on to people and situations that cause you pain. Be yourself so the people looking for you can find you Make a lot of friends especially outside your course Enjoy yourself  Partyyyyyyy Don’t date ashesi boys frfr cos eiiiiii? What if I am drunk bruv ?? If you're struggling in class, don't struggle alone. Get help!!! There are so many people willing to help you succeed  Be yourself.  Those people you're trying to impress don't matter in the end Run Away  Girrlllllll, IGNORE THAT NIGGER‼️ I really beg😭 You don't have to be an engineering major to take engineering courses. Don't choose big classes. That man you left home is not your man👍
Loosen up, reply those guys dms and get yourself a present man.
Thank you Stop playing Don’t date any cs boy Ashesi FIs must go to hell. They’ll spend the whole semester not marking attendance and choose to do it only when they notice that someone is missing. Mark the thing everyday, don’t come and spoil our records by making insignificant things significant. Why do you think we have free misses?  Can’t get Love me Jeje out of my head… it’s literally been a week since Ubora, that girl owned the performance  Come for prayer conference 🫵🏾🫵🏾 Wigs are so much stress  Can we talk about the double standards in Ashesi? 
ASC can’t play music durong programs during school hours , but when the program includes staff, to hell with the rules, just look at the noise from the drums on Friday. Smh, ethics where?  Please let’s beware of the on-campus apple charger bandit Just heard about the passport events for the 27s. I think it’s a very bad idea. Forcing people to go to events never works. I guess that’s why the participation is so low I think people should say who they think has nice braids and who doesn't. It's possible some people haven't heard the truth yet. I said “yoo bro” 
He said “hi” 

Eww Must I always have to borrow from the next day?? 
 This is a Christmas break not a vacation… We deserve rest too!!!

 Someone pls tell Patrick that I’m ethical and entrepreneurial minded buh the courage to change this continent dier let’s leave it to Bahuballi…. I can’t 😭
","She repeatedly attends classes dressed as if she were going to a nightclub, and when he asked if they would party together, it was a clear no. It is good that you have found God, but I will not forget how promiscuous you were last year. The suspect is a male mechanical engineering student graduating in 2025. After the Women of Color conference, I have not written any essay myself. I am curious about the logic behind sitting directly under an air conditioner and complaining about being cold.  Perhaps we should stop setting air conditioners above room temperature; 30 degrees Celsius is excessively warm for an air conditioner—we are not trying to heat ourselves, my dear. The semester is over; let us pack our belongings and go home. I find it amusing how hard Akornor is trying, acting like a typical man—giving the bare minimum until competition arises. Let's review the award winners. Did they truly deserve their awards? I am exhausted.  Dying in November or December is not ideal, is it? Perhaps January, after the holiday season? Talk to that girl. Do not prioritize people who do not prioritize you. If they find another person or group more enjoyable to spend time with, do not beg them for their attention. Please respect yourself and move on. You deserve better! Leave. Why did you abandon God and attempt to handle everything alone? STAY AWAY FROM THAT BOY, PLEASE!  Devote more effort to your academics and cultivate friendships that will foster your growth. Sleep, please. You can study all night and still not achieve a B grade. Who advises these 2027 male students to braid their hair? Mind your own business.  Friend, just sleep. Whatever happens will happen. Whether you study all night or only for an hour, you will receive the same grade, I promise you. I would advise her not to develop a crush on every attractive boy she encounters. You will not end up with any of them, sweetheart. Things will improve. They will tell you that you will be fine; do not listen to them. You are being overly emotional. Calm down! You have four years, not one month. Do not take things personally. Work on yourself and take small steps daily to achieve your desired results. Small consistent actions matter. Learn to let go and avoid holding grudges; it is better to be free than to cling to people and situations that cause you pain. Be yourself so that the people who are looking for you can find you. Make many friends, especially outside your course. Enjoy yourself! Party! Do not date Ashesi boys; it's a bad idea. What if I am intoxicated? If you are struggling in class, do not struggle alone. Seek help! Many people are willing to assist you in succeeding. Be yourself. The people you are trying to impress ultimately do not matter. Run away. Girl, ignore that man! I sincerely beg you. You do not need to be an engineering major to take engineering courses. Do not choose large classes. That man you left at home is not your man. Relax, respond to those guys' direct messages, and buy yourself a gift. Thank you. Stop playing games. Do not date any computer science student. Ashesi Finance students should go to hell. They spend the entire semester not taking attendance and only do so when they notice someone is missing. Mark attendance daily; do not ruin our records by making insignificant things significant. Why do you think we have excused absences? I cannot get ""Love me Jeje"" out of my head; it has been a week since Ubora's performance, and that girl owned the stage. Come to the prayer conference. Wigs are so stressful. Can we discuss the double standards at Ashesi? The Ashesi Student Council cannot play music during school-hour programs, but when staff are involved, the rules are disregarded—just listen to the noise from the drums on Friday.  Where is the ethics? Please, let us be wary of the on-campus Apple charger thief. I just heard about the passport events for the 2027 class. I think it is a terrible idea. Forcing people to attend events never works; I suppose that is why participation is so low. I think people should openly share their opinions on who has nice braids and who does not. Some people may not have heard the truth yet. I said, ""Hey, bro."" He said, ""Hi.""  Ugh. Must I always borrow from the next day? This is a Christmas break, not a vacation; we deserve rest too! Someone please tell Patrick that I am ethical and entrepreneurial, but the courage to change this continent—let's leave that to Bahubali. I cannot."

Yay, I got the grades I wanted but here I am almost done with second year and I barely have any fun memories I can look back on. 2025 better come with a load of wild adventures and unforgettable moments cos I'm done being just another stressed-out student. To the 28 girls. When you come, make sure you find a boy in 25 to study and pray with🙏 So we won't get the pictures of UBORA this year??? Abi next dem go come take again. To that one fresher... I promise we don't bite. Some of us have rbfs but like we're really chill people😭 🫦 Honestly, study. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you you’re doing too much. Learn. At the end of the day, you will know you are making your parents proud and making use of your school fees. It is a cannon event for you to get into a situationship with a senior in your first year. Know that it is not going anywhere. Don’t be stupid Guard your heart cos we are coming

Prepare to be stressed  Avoid 25 and 26 boys like the plague. They will come for you like the predators they are, but run.  Don’t date Ghanaian women 25s boys are  EVIL, 26s boys kiss and tell( they can gossip herh ), and 27s are just distasteful in general, focus on your books don’t let pressure catch you  Don’t put pressure on yourselves. Trust the process ❤️ Don't be under pressure because of the lifestyle on campus guys, not all that glitters is gold☺️🙅 Maintain your standards🙏 Don’t succumb to the ashesi status quo. Be as free as possible, have as much fun as you can. ❤️❤️ Chaley word is simple... Studies, Sleep and Chilling - you can only have the best of two. Choose wisely lol! When you go to Ubora don't take pictures cos them no go send am to you Never undermine your potentials. You are here because you fit in. Pray, be optimistic, work hard and smart, and be respectful. You might suffer at the beginning and even doubt your potentials; but through hardwork and persistence, you'll get to the end successfully. And, it will all make sense eventually🫶.  To the C’28 don’t neglect your spiritual life oo🧏🏾‍♀️ Ashesi can deal with you in ways that only God can help see you through. So please find God if you haven’t, find a church(I recommend KCF😊)and be consistent there. Enjoy the journey. Have fun and make lifelong friends don’t let anybody’s son or daughter stress you 😘 Don't be pressured to be spiritual or religious if that isn't for you. Find your own path. 
Explore. Do what you want. 
 Chale Ashesi is cold oh kwerh😭😭 I don't want to scare you but Ashesi is scary. 
Welcomeeee ☺☺ Welcome huzz🥹 Dear C’28, I don’t know what you’ve heard about Ashesi being fun, but it’s not; you have to make it fun for yourself. Know this and know peace😌  Run away Chill within this orientation week or never get to! Ohe step at a time. Build the right habits and repeatable routines early. They'll help you sale on autopilot when when your drive is down. Build a support system from which you can tap help and provide help for others. Go beyond school work: your value lies beyond your academic scores. Intentionally have fun. All the best Stay away from the 27 boys please. The school in itself is stressful enough  Welcome to Ashesi is a warning❗️But enjoy orientation🌚 28 girls, stay away from the 27 boys😭. They’re thrifty though Ran away 🤧 Stay away from Gilbert Tetteh If you’re doing CE just stop. Go to CS Stay away from Caleb Atakora  Be open hearted and minded… you can get and feel the best from this campus🤎.
And congratulations🎊… this’ such a great achievement.","As a new first-year student, I hope everyone is kind to us because I am secretly scared.  At the same time, I am very excited. I cannot wait to be there. Okay, I understand: I am an engineering student, but did I really have to be a relentlessly focused, grade-obsessed student?  Yes, I got the grades I wanted, but here I am, almost finished with my second year, and I hardly have any fun memories.  2025 better bring a lot of exciting adventures and unforgettable moments because I am done being just another stressed-out student. To the 28 girls: when you arrive, find a boy in the 25 class to study and pray with.  Will we not have the Ubora pictures this year? Or will they take them next year? To that new student: I promise we are not mean. Some of us have resting-bitch-face, but we are really relaxed people. Honestly, study. Do not listen to anyone who says you are doing too much. Learn.  At the end of the day, you will know you are making your parents proud and using your school fees wisely. It is a bad idea to start a casual relationship with a senior in your first year. Know that it will not last. Do not be foolish. Protect your heart because we are coming!

—A C’27 boy

Dear C’28 girls, please come and drink, party, and have fun! Shake things up! Have fun; this is one of the best times… Start looking around, is all I will say. You will be fine, trust me! Prepare to be stressed. Avoid the boys in the 25 and 26 classes like the plague. They will pursue you like predators, but run. Do not date Ghanaian women. The 25 boys are evil, the 26 boys gossip, and the 27 boys are generally unpleasant. Focus on your studies; do not let pressure get to you. Do not put pressure on yourselves. Trust the process. Do not be pressured by the campus lifestyle; not everything that glitters is gold. Maintain your standards. Do not succumb to the Ashesi status quo. Be as free as possible; have as much fun as you can.  The advice is simple: studies, sleep, and chilling—you can only have the best of two. Choose wisely! When you go to Ubora, do not take pictures because they will not send them to you. Never underestimate your potential. You are here because you belong. Pray, be optimistic, work hard and smart, and be respectful. You might struggle at first and even doubt your abilities, but through hard work and persistence, you will succeed. And it will all make sense eventually.

To the C’28 class: do not neglect your spiritual life. Ashesi can challenge you in ways that only God can help you overcome. So please, find God if you haven’t already, find a church (I recommend KCF), and be consistent. Enjoy the journey. Have fun and make lifelong friends; do not let anyone stress you. Do not feel pressured to be spiritual or religious if that is not for you. Find your own path. Explore. Do what you want.

Ashesi is cold! I do not want to scare you, but Ashesi is scary. Welcome! Welcome! Dear C’28, I do not know what you have heard about Ashesi being fun, but it is not; you have to make it fun for yourself. Know this and know peace. Relax during orientation week or you will never get to! One step at a time. Build good habits and consistent routines early. They will help you keep going when your motivation is low. Build a support system from which you can get help and provide help to others. Go beyond schoolwork; your value is more than your academic scores. Intentionally have fun. All the best. Stay away from the 27 boys, please. The school itself is stressful enough. Welcome to Ashesi is a warning! But enjoy orientation. C’28 girls, stay away from the 27 boys! They are stingy, though. Run away! Stay away from Gilbert Tetteh. If you are doing Computer Engineering, just stop. Go to Computer Science. Stay away from Caleb Atakora. Be open-hearted and open-minded… you can get and feel the best from this campus.

And congratulations… this is such a great achievement."
Week 64,"I don't know how best to say this but you have to pray and study. Go beyond your grades. Your first year friends might not be your ride or die, it's totally fine. What matters is having people who align with your values. Don't compare yourself to others and fight imposter syndrome. 
Ashesi is not fun. Relationship might work or not. Just make sure you don't lose yourself Your fight is against a system 28. All that glitters isn't gold.

Sleepless nights😭😭 Minding my business😘I hope we all learn to do that as well I beg, you don’t need to know everything🙏🏾 The engineers were such a vibe. Arguably the most sociable people I met at Ashesi. Massaaaa, bring the c27 boys, we are ready  One if the 24s really changed my life… she would always sit and listen to me rant on how my life was hard for hours, mind you, she had capstone going on and other courses worrying her. She taught me to be me and showed me how to let go of some burdens. Trust me, she’s been a strong pillar in one of my best transformations. She made me befriend so many people. In other words, God really used her to work some things out in my life. I really don’t know how I’m going to live in this same school with my ex way back from Christian high. I think I still have some feeling for him when I see his muscles 🤭🤭. I’m just a girl🙂‍↔️ I really don’t know if I can stay in this campus as a fresher with my ex from Christian high. I think I still have feelings for him and I heard he’s at hosanna 😭😭 So you applied because of CRAZY DAY 🤣🤣. Wow, all the best To my dear gentlemen who use Ashesi's washroom facilities. PLEAASEE!! IF YOU CAN'T AIM SIT DOWN. Dear C’28,
Watch out for the charger bandit. Guys please bath well and use deodorant!! some of you nearly killed me during orientation 😭🙏🏽 Eih the way these 28 girls are looking dier I'm sure my crush will fall for one of them🥹","I do not know the best way to express this, but you must pray and study diligently.  Strive for more than just good grades. Your first-year friends may not remain your closest confidantes, and that is perfectly acceptable. What truly matters is surrounding yourself with people who share your values. Avoid comparing yourself to others and combat feelings of inadequacy.

Ashesi University is not always enjoyable. Relationships may flourish or fail.  The most important thing is to maintain your sense of self. Your struggle is against a challenging system. Remember that appearances can be deceiving. Focus on staying on the right path and seek mentors early in your academic journey. Cultivate strong friendships and be as sociable as possible.

The female students in the Class of 2025, 2026, and 2027 should be cautious; the male students have arrived—specifically, the Class of 2028 males. I have just arrived, and I already want to leave!  Kelvin Bosso is wearing a tank top because of the many female students.  Some Ashesi male students are very handsome. I am seeing my ideal partner everywhere. Even walking to the gym is a strenuous workout—it is so far away! Meeting new people is never easy. Hopefully, the Class of 2028 will be easygoing. I am looking forward to seeing the Class of 2027 male students everyone warned me about.  The warnings about the Class of 2027 male students are intriguing; I want to see for myself.

My romantic partner is difficult to deal with. The costs associated with attending Ashesi are high, but I will manage. I miss my boyfriend terribly. The Ashesi Snapchat account is inactive; there are no updates since the Class of 2028 arrived on campus. I want to start pursuing romantic interests; please provide updates! I cannot believe that on Monday I will be in class as if this vacation never happened.  I gained seven pounds; please forgive me. It was not entirely my fault. I look good; that is all that matters. The long vacation was wonderful.  The Class of 2028 has arrived. I just want to graduate. I am looking forward to rekindling my complicated relationship. Call me ""bae."" I hope for a calm semester with less stress. I look forward to the next end-of-semester break.

I am already tired. The Class of 2027 male students should stay away from the female students. I look forward to the new Ashesi Student Council. I cannot wait to be reunited with my close friends. It is time for the Class of 2026 female students to find romantic partners.  I look forward to mid-semester break. I am looking forward to surpassing my rivals.  Honestly, I am eager for commencement; the school is very strict. I find even the first week intimidating. Now that the semester is longer, I hope to see more student participation in sports and clubs. Last semester was depressing. This school is unnecessarily stressful. I look forward to my final semester. I cannot wait to graduate and distance myself from certain people. Life has been difficult, but I believe it is about to improve. I look forward to encountering confused freshmen in the hallways. I enjoy pretending to be confused so that they think I am a freshman, then surprising them later—it is priceless!  Mid-semester break—or is it too early?  Am I looking forward to anything?  I dread even thinking about returning to school.  I have experienced sleepless nights. I am focusing on my own affairs. I hope we all learn to do the same.  You do not need to know everything. The engineering students were very sociable; arguably the most sociable people I met at Ashesi. Bring the Class of 2027 male students; we are ready. One of the Class of 2024 students significantly impacted my life. She always listened to me complain about my difficulties for hours, even while dealing with her capstone project and other academic pressures. She encouraged me to be myself and helped me release some burdens. She has been a strong support during my personal growth. She helped me befriend many people. In essence, God used her to help me overcome challenges. I do not know how I will manage living on the same campus as my ex-boyfriend from Christian High School. I think I still have feelings for him when I see his physique. I am just a girl. I do not know if I can remain on campus as a freshman with my ex-boyfriend from Christian High School. I think I still have feelings for him, and I heard he is at Hosanna. You applied because of Crazy Day? Wow, best of luck! To the male students who use Ashesi's restroom facilities: please, if you cannot aim, sit down. Class of 2028, beware of the charger thief.  Gentlemen, please bathe regularly and use deodorant! Some of you nearly overwhelmed me during orientation.  Given how attractive the Class of 2028 female students are, I am sure my crush will develop an interest in one of them."
Week 65,"First day of school and we’re being harassed for ID cards? Are the security men looking for new jobs on campus or what???? The way some of the people type the English and attack some people it is definitely Deborah in 25 typing it😂😂😂 It wasn’t bad but some of the lessons are boringgggggggg. Ei eny3 oh!!  Registry have to do better I want to go home 😭😭😭 When is the semester ending?  This naija girl is making me see stars🫚 It was alright.  Still getting used to things, but I'll be fine eventually. Was amazing, felt really cool! The KCF program for Freshers was a good set up for the next day.. it really got me to calm down about my first day fears🥲. Glad I went  Chale I want to go home😔 Charlie Ashesi Lecturers wossup, some already teaching and gave assignments sef the first day.  First day? I’m still in Detty December o😭🥲 hi boo, sleeping in class when the teacher is right in front of you doesn't make you cool btw!!🫶🏾✨ He’s shooting blanks!! Fuck niggas decentralize men 2025 Erm personally I think that boy is cute 🤷🏽‍♀️ That sexc boy in 27😏😏 nkod  Should I ask my actual or my sneaky link to be my valentine? Decisions, decisions... Is Nkod in 27 single ?? Cupid shot a year and a half ago and is still shooting, still booed up ✨ Ideal valentines: In my room, eating chocolate, prolly watching a movie. Added bonus: No assignments due Let’s make Val’s day a big deal this year, with cute proposals and all of that!! You don’t even need to have a romantic partner, it could be your friend group, study partner, situationship, talking stage, sneaky link, side nigga… CELEBRATE IT WITH SOMEONE! Can the ASC do the Cupid sendit on snap again please🥺 Can the school plan some fun activity for people who want Valentines to come together and shoot their shot or something?  This year my girls and I are having a little galentines date. It's not everyday boy boy‼️ Text me babe😔👉👈 Dodging all the arrows 😏😭 It really is because we are breathing love-filled air on Campus🥹❤️❤️ At least l get to be part of the shooting😌 Eih, then these arrows have sedatives in them paa oh, I feel like sleepwalking😭😭😭 Ashesi Basketball Association, letting the girls play for 5 minutes is a complete insult. They were there to play a full game. This is unacceptable and reflects poorly on your sports program and LEADERSHIP!  And what the hell was that female coach in red doing? The ref as well!!!! Where was her support for the females team? This kind of pathetic ""leadership"" just highlights the blatant gender discrimination Why would they stop the girls basket ball match at less than 3 mins???
Then we talk about inclusion!!! smh😑 We were playing basketball and some guy in 2025 with braided hair and beads at the end stopped our game abruptly. We are trying to advance an agenda where girls can be partakers in games and activities outside of academia but how can we do that we we are not even treated with dignity and respect. 
The guy in question stopped the game and said we were done playing when we asked why he repeated the same thing and when we tried to talk some sense into his faulty reasoning he spoke about time and the games starting late 
Now it was not our fault as we were at the court way earlier 5:30 to be exact and we waited for our turns to play 
We were pushing the agenda further to continue our game on the court and the guy was rude to us 
This form of injustice for the mere reason that we are girls or that we are just starting in basketball is not good at all 
How then do we leave a legacy of female basketball players 😭 Quite interesting to see how far back some people’s mindset. Gotta be a darn achievement , here’s your trophy. The idea of girls not being as good as boys in sports is an archaic thinking some people still seem to hold dear to their heart. Oh well, let’s give thanks to God for a good night. Less than five minutes of gameplay for women basketball, quite discombobulating. Didn’t know that was a standard in a basketball game. Why is there gender disparity in the school when we claim that there is gender equality. This is why most girls are not encouraged to play basketball in Ashesi. The sports committee should do something about this.
 Ashesi Basketball Association, where is the inclusivity? Girls have been asking to play, but you’ve never wanted to include us. Why did we have to fight just to be heard? We tried to form our own club, but it’s like our interests were never taken seriously. 

 Making people play for only 5 minutes is beyond disrespectful. Is this what fairness looks like at Ashesi? The lack of support for girls in basketball says a lot about inclusivity and representation at Ashesi as a university. This needs to change.

 To all the girls who love basketball: Your passion deserves recognition. We shouldn’t have to keep fighting for a seat at the table. Basketball is more than just a game—it’s a community. Excluding girls from fully participating takes away from what this community could be. Most boring interclass final game ever!!!!!!!  Equality in sports isn’t a privilege; it’s a right. Ashesi prides itself on being inclusive, so why isn’t that reflected in the Basketball Association? Girls deserve the same opportunities to grow, compete, and thrive in sports. Why is this even up for debate in 2025?

 Do you know how heartbreaking it is to love a sport so much, only to feel like you don’t belong? This is deeper than basketball—it’s about respect and dignity. Let's remind the guys in the ABA that they're playing for fun,and they're not getting paid, so they might as well respect the ladies and give them space to function. Seriously did not expect such behaviour from Ashesi guys especially with all that hardwork put into our curriculum concerning gender inequality. I pity 'his' parents though😪 The leaders of Ashesi basketball Association should think of their leadership twice ...some of them are just disappoinment, they are killing talents .....😏😏 Letting girls play for three minutes and stopping their game is crazy....Mr watso ever who stopped the game u better sit down and think of urself  Education system is stressing  us ...and yet you normal human being u want to stress people too in basketball for real.... The referee of today's basketball game...eat those balls to urself😏😏u could at least give the girls a chance to show what they have  Please can't ladies start approaching boys since we are in an inclusive environment? 
Saying I love you to a man won't kill anyone.
We are tired of you ladies sending us to our fellow men. Talk to them by yourselves. Enough about the ABA. Can we talk about roommates with partners? Just because your roommate is okay with your partner visiting doesn't mean your partner should make the room their second room. Remember, we all paid for the room. Mid January The Ink still dey rep Christmas hat😂We also miss the Detty December chale😪 Dating someone who loves you and wants to date you>>>>
10000% recommended! Please it’s not deeper than basketball. It’s just about basketball and turnout. Did y’all see how even fellow women left as the game proceeded? You think they don’t respect you?","My first day of school, and they're already demanding ID cards?  Are the security guards trying to find new campus jobs or something?  Some people's English and the way they verbally attacked others—it was definitely Deborah in room 25 writing those comments! 😂 It wasn't terrible, but some classes were incredibly boring. Goodness! The Registry needs to improve; I want to go home! 😭😭😭 When does this semester end? This Nigerian girl is driving me crazy! 🫚 It was okay. I'm still adjusting, but I'll be fine eventually. The KCF program for freshmen was a good introduction to the next day; it really calmed my first-day anxieties. 🥲 I'm glad I went. Friend, I want to go home. 😔 Some Ashesi lecturers are already assigning homework on the first day!  It's still the holiday season for me! 😭🥲 Hi, sweetheart, sleeping in class when the teacher is right in front of you doesn't make you cool, by the way!! 🫶🏾✨ He's not interested in a relationship!  Men need to diversify their choices in 2025. Personally, I think that boy is cute. 🤷🏽‍♀️ That attractive boy in room 27 😏😏 My sweetheart Should I ask my boyfriend or my casual partner to be my Valentine? Decisions, decisions… Is the sweetheart in room 27 single?? Cupid shot an arrow a year and a half ago and is still shooting, still coupled up. ✨ My ideal Valentine's Day: In my room, eating chocolate, probably watching a movie. Bonus: No assignments due! Let's make Valentine's Day a big deal this year, with cute proposals and all that! You don't even need a romantic partner; it could be your friend group, study partner, casual relationship, someone you're talking to, a casual partner… CELEBRATE IT WITH SOMEONE! Can the Ashesi Student Council please do the Cupid send on Snapchat again? 🥺 Can the school plan some fun activities for people who want to find a Valentine and make a move or something? This year, my girlfriends and I are having a Galentine's Day date. It's not every day it's all about the guys!  Text me, baby. 😔👉👈 Avoiding all the romantic advances. 😏😭 It really feels like we are breathing love-filled air on campus. 🥹❤️❤️ At least I get to participate in the dating scene. 😌 Oh my, these romantic advances are incredibly strong; I feel like I'm sleepwalking. 😭😭😭 The Ashesi Basketball Association, letting the girls play for five minutes is a complete insult.

Week 66,"But like sup with the Mr.Ebo guy. He'll be telling us to read the computing materials but will use lecture hours to teach us about the milky way and galaxy. It's getting out of hand.Something tells me teaching computer science was his second choice. Am I safe or? Is this a Ghaniain culture or I am in a wrong circle?, someone monitoring all your moves, when and what you eat, when you wake up, what you do when you wake, when you read, how long your alarm is. This would be okay but going around sharing them to other people?
No private life at all 🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢😱😱😱😱😱😱 More parties‼️
May Akwaaba Night not be the first and last party this Academic year abeg✋️ Old school songs pleaseeee Psquare for akwaaba night Any thing dancehall Please guys, let's not do like how that Happy Hour was during orientation week. Biko 😔 Do we have to bring a date because ei Aside ASC week, this was the only fun and memorable day i had in my first year. I am really looking forward to 'stomping the ground' 🤭. 'That eez wat I came for, yesss'.  Limited edition by Shenseea
Position by Shenseea
Run the city by Cindy(uganda) change your life - Fireboy DML  and JIGGLE & WHINE - Stonebwoy (feat Spice) Everyone should put that shy, ""I'm new here"",""I don't know a lot of people"", attitude somewhere and have fun. Dancing and chilling won't kill your aura and steeze biaa😒😒 For the love of Onyankopon in the sky, old songs are  okay but it shouldn't be for the whole program, mix in some popular tiktok sounds from around the world please, some of us get new songs from there, we beg🥲🥲
But anyways, Who born the maga, by Wande Coal is also okay Idk… Are you there by Rema and anything.  Song requests:
JUDAH - Dunsin Oyekan
Ko'rale & GreatMan Takit — ""Commando""
Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta - NO ONE
The Band FRA! - YOU DEY FEEL THE VIBE (ft. Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta) Song requests for Akwaaba night- anything amapiano, anything on wizkid's new album(morayo), any rema song.
Thank you. Pbee - Space Can someone please tell the school to slow down with the emails? Emails are for formal communications. Why are you using it to promote businesses or some AFA league? Can we have a separate group or something for that? Clubs can do that. We are missing out on the important stuff I grew up knowing that women speak a lot and have no secrets but Ashesi  boys/men have proved me wrong. Oh can’t we become men again?? Guys can talk 🥲🥲🥲🥲
 No line will work if she’s not already interested in you. All my life, I have never been someone's valentine
ahn, did they swear for me 🤣🤣 She's not a bad texter
Or a bad talker 
She's not super busy 
Or asleep early
Or in church 
She just doesn't like you bro
Move on I might not have rizz, but what I do have is a big lonely heart waiting to feel loved. Shoot your shot,cupid got nothin' on you hun😏 This one Hallmark server serving more attitude than food Hallmark should take a very big step back from serving a whole portion of jollof and 2 portions chicken in a burger pack.  Honestly, the way to a girl’s heart is through her friend’s heart. Boys please buy your girl’s friend chocolate too😭 She’ll take care of the rest😂 Yall should be confident and ask her outttttttttttt😉 Walk up to her
Look DEEEEP in her eyes
In Gru's voice, go ""hey bebi GORLLLLL""
Smirk
Now turn and run away yelling ""IT'S DONEEEEE""

Watch her fall in love Remember; rizz is 80% vibe, 20% words. Just be confident. Unspoken rule... Do not overly confident as a rizzler! I just know people are coming to type nonsense 😭🤚
Please just be gentlemen this is not high school or middle school 😌👍 Just dress well and smell nice but don’t suffocate us with your perfume or cologne, we beg Jon. DJ Kiki was the only memorable DJ. THE BEST DJ😍...also, these DJs should know there's more to life than Amapiano that we've been playing since last year January. And please don't allow that last MC to ever stand on a stage again. So irritating and cringe😒 Chale best night of my life, has altered my brain chemistry 🙂‍↕️, created new core memories chale forgettttt😝😝💥 Don Nortey did his thing! Shout out to every other performer as well🫡💯 I just went for food and it was good especially that khebab. They should come again. The vibe was there and overall it was a good night. Looking forward to more events by the ASC 😃. Honestly, alot of the mixing wasn't impressive. One of the best Akwaba Night since I came to Ashesi. 
Welcome class of 2028 Kiki ATEEEEEE ZOWNNNNNNN Don Nortey killed it!!! My favorite DJ of the night Best night ever, looking forward to having more nights like this. 10/10 experience for reallllll It was ass. Absolutely loved Akwaaba night! I enjoyed every bit of it, kudos to the new ASC I made love for the first time on Akwaaba night! Don Nortey cooked🤩 I am sorry,not to be mean this akwaaba night ,the committee no try at all ,talk about the DJs, what was that all about,, if you are holding a real party, change the way you play songs ,they are not inviting at all... let's do better for ASC week ,..","What is going on with Mr. Ebo? He tells us to read the computing materials, but then uses lecture time to teach us about the Milky Way and galaxies.  It's excessive. I have a feeling that teaching computer science wasn't his first choice. Am I wrong? Is this a Ghanaian cultural thing, or am I in the wrong environment? Someone is monitoring all my movements: when and what I eat, when I wake up, what I do when I wake up, when I read, and how long my alarm is set for. That would be acceptable, but sharing this information with others?  There is absolutely no privacy whatsoever!  More parties!

I hope Akwaaba Night is not the only party this academic year. Please, old school songs! P-Square for Akwaaba Night! Anything dancehall! Please, let's not repeat the Happy Hour disaster from orientation week.  Aside from ASC week, this was the only fun and memorable day of my first year. I am really looking forward to enjoying myself. That is what I came for!

My song requests:
* Limited Edition by Shenseea
* Position by Shenseea
* Run the City by Cindy (Uganda)
* Change Your Life - Fireboy DML
* Jiggle & Whine - Stonebwoy (feat. Spice)

Everyone should put aside any shyness or feelings of being new and have fun. Dancing and relaxing won't harm your aura. For goodness sake, old songs are fine, but not for the entire program. Mix in some popular TikTok sounds from around the world; some of us discover new music that way.

But anyway, Who Born the Maga by Wande Coal is also acceptable.  Other suggestions:
* Are You There by Rema
* Judah - Dunsin Oyekan
* Ko'rale & GreatMan Takit — Commando
* Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta - No One
* The Band FRA! - You Dey Feel The Vibe (ft. Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta)

More Akwaaba Night song requests: anything amapiano, anything from Wizkid's new album (Morayo), and any Rema song. Thank you.  Space by Pbee.

Can someone please tell the school to reduce the number of emails? Emails are for formal communication. Why are they using them to promote businesses or some AFA league? Can we have a separate group for that? Clubs can handle that. We are missing important information. I grew up believing that women talk a lot and have no secrets, but Ashesi boys/men have proven me wrong. Can we be more open and communicative? Guys can talk! No romantic connection will develop if she is not already interested. I have never been anyone's Valentine.  Did they swear at me? She is not a bad texter, talker, or super busy; she's not asleep early or in church; she just doesn't like me. I need to move on. I may not have romantic skills, but I have a big lonely heart waiting to be loved. Take a chance; you've got this! Hallmark should reconsider serving a full portion of jollof rice and two portions of chicken in a burger pack. The way to a girl's heart is through her friend's heart. Boys, buy her friend chocolate too! She will take care of the rest. Be confident and ask her out! Walk up to her, look deeply into her eyes, and in Gru's voice, say, ""Hey, bebi gorlll!"" Smirk, then turn and run away yelling, ""It's doneeee!"" Watch her fall in love. Remember, romantic skill is 80% vibe and 20% words. Just be confident, but not overly confident. I know some people will write nonsense. Please be gentlemen; this is not high school or middle school. Dress well and smell nice, but don't suffocate us with your perfume or cologne. DJ Kiki was the best DJ! These DJs should know there's more to life than amapiano, which we've been playing since January. And please don't let that last MC ever stand on a stage again.  Best night of my life! Don Nortey did his thing! Shout out to every other performer. The food was good, especially the kebab. The vibe was great, and it was a good night overall. Looking forward to more events by the ASC. Honestly, a lot of the mixing wasn't impressive. One of the best Akwaaba Nights since I came to Ashesi. Welcome, class of 2028! Kiki was amazing! Don Nortey killed it! My favorite DJ of the night! Best night ever! 10/10 experience! It was awesome! Absolutely loved Akwaaba Night! I enjoyed every bit of it; kudos to the new ASC! I made love for the first time on Akwaaba Night! Don Nortey was fantastic! I'm sorry to be blunt, but this Akwaaba Night, the committee didn't try at all. The DJs were terrible. If you're holding a real party, change the way you play songs; they weren't inviting at all. Let's do better for ASC week."
Week 67,"Sim racing during wellness Wednesday 
 Do better than the previous government. No long talk. Evidence  Apprehensive about any change in student body honestly
 African wedding  Entertainment committee should bring a better person for ASC WEEK Be private and sweet. Berekuso isn't Netflix and no one really wants a public display. People have got sh8t going on and are trying to go about their day normally The boys sitting in front of registry today. Damnnnnn🤭🤭🤭 Take their hand, look into their eyes, stare deep into their souls and tell them, ""I love you everyday but allow me to show you just how much. Will you be my valentine?"" Men, men, men, listen and listen good
This valentine's day, it's not ""the thought that counts""
I heard that some of you don't intend to ask your girlfriends to be your valentines because they are meant to automatically know. 
Please think again. Put effort into the proposal. Don't just say it, for the love of God, don't just use words. You have 364/365 days to do that. Go all out. Make her feel special. If you can't afford something extravagant, a small, simple thing she likes or has mentioned before is more than enough. It doesn't cost a lot to attach a note. 
Just SHOW her that you care. You've told her enough. 
Good luck! A simple, cute card with some cupcakes 💋 Don't ask at all Prayer👌 Through her friend😭 Have pure intentions and ask out  in a cute way,a way that you would like to be proposed in.🤭 Be straightforward 🤣 Walk up to her and ask 
""DO YOU WANNA BUILD A SNOWMAN?""
The worst she will say is no
You both will laugh
If it doesn't go right. By not asking 😒🥱 A Vals-proposal just like the way they do Promposals in SA. I don’t even need too much🤭. Slide a note in my bag telling me how you feel about me. Then slide another one asking me to be your valentine. Talk to me like I’m your valentine from the  till valz day. If you want, we could continue too🤭.  I honestly hope this boy will read all the ideas you’re going to give him because the way he doesn’t care kills me. I also want to call him my man but he’s too careless. Guys/Girls please advise your friends😭.  I want to make this vals day a special one for my man but I’m scared everyone will say I do too much. I promise I love him like that😭. But I guess I’ll just sit here and plan it out in my head. How I want to order him a very masculine package and remind him how much I love him because he means so much. Why do I want to give him a small gift every day from now till vals day?😭 A girl can only think. This and more!(**sigh**) Don’t ask! Just show up on Valentine’s Day with a box of Chocolate and like 1000 Cedis!! We girls love that! ❤️ Ask in private😂 Don’t do it Put your head on my shoulderrrr
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight, show me
That you love me toooo Friendship ghosting is not cool...maybe we shouldn't have met?","Sim racing during Wellness Wednesday.  Do better than the previous government. No lengthy explanations needed; show me the evidence. I am apprehensive about any change in the student body, honestly.

Regarding the African wedding, the Entertainment Committee should select a more competent person for ASC Week. Keep it private and intimate. Berekuso is not Netflix; nobody wants a public display. People have their own lives and are trying to go about their day normally.

Those men sitting in front of the registry today… Wow! Take their hand, look into their eyes, gaze deep into their souls, and tell them, ""I love you every day, but let me show you just how much. Will you be my Valentine?""

Men, listen carefully. This Valentine's Day, it's not about ""the thought that counts."" I hear some of you do not intend to ask your girlfriends to be your Valentines because they should automatically know. Reconsider that. Put effort into the proposal. Do not just say it; for goodness sake, do not just use words. You have 364 out of 365 days to do that. Go all out. Make her feel special. If you cannot afford something extravagant, a small, simple thing she likes or has mentioned before is more than sufficient. It does not cost much to include a note. Just show her that you care. You have told her enough.

Good luck! A simple, cute card with some cupcakes would be nice.  Do not ask at all. Pray. Ask through her friend. Have pure intentions and ask in a cute way, a way you would like to be proposed to. Be straightforward. Walk up to her and ask, ""Do you want to build a snowman?"" The worst she can say is no. You will both laugh. If it does not go well, it is because you did not ask. A Valentine's Day proposal, just like they do promposals in South Africa. I do not even need much. Slide a note into my bag telling me how you feel about me. Then slide another one asking me to be your Valentine. Talk to me like I am your Valentine from now until Valentine's Day. If you want, we can continue. I honestly hope this boy will read all the ideas you are going to give him because his lack of care kills me. I also want to call him my man, but he is too careless. Guys and girls, please advise your friends.

I want to make this Valentine's Day special for my man, but I am afraid everyone will say I do too much. I promise I love him that much. But I guess I will just sit here and plan it out in my head. How I want to order him a very masculine package and remind him how much I love him because he means so much. Why do I want to give him a small gift every day from now until Valentine's Day? A girl can only think. This and more! (sigh) Do not ask! Just show up on Valentine's Day with a box of chocolates and about 1000 Cedis! We girls love that! Ask in private. Do not do it. Put your head on my shoulder. Hold me in your arms, baby. Squeeze me oh so tight, show me that you love me too. Friendship ghosting is not cool… maybe we should not have met."

 He gave me dark chocolate with sea salt😭 Someone tell her to PLEASE break no contact  I was dating 2 guys at the same time😪
So the one l loved didn't get me anything but the one who loved me got me a Money bouquet and a human sized Teddy.(I hope you get it😉) To cut the long story short, l posted the gifts from the man who loved me and ended up losing the one l loved🥲 He didn’t make his move before valentines, so I bought a cake for myself on the Val’s day in the name of self love and this nigga came to eat the cake with me😭 very shameless human being! My mumu self couldn’t utter a word…hmm None. Never been celebrated on a Val’s day. But if the guy I’ve been sending signals to catches them (though they’re weak af), I’m definitely writing a successful story 🥹♥️ Hmm.. it’s a normal day for some of us 😭We have no stories yet🙈","Hedia Araba and Vladimir Kwadwo are a good match; Maame and Kwame are also a good pair.

GW1 Complaints:

Kasanoma's disallowed goal; the referee calling offside on every counter-attack; an unfair penalty against the Red Army; Player of the Week awarded to an elite player when Kasanoma vs. Red Army was the game of the week. Apologize to Faisal immediately. ASC, where are the funds from last semester? Why should we pay dues and entertain you at the same time? My crush isn't so secret (he's my boyfriend). He is intelligent, compassionate, funny, emotionally intelligent, handsome, romantic, talented, hardworking… the list goes on. His smile is like sunshine on a cloudy day. Keli (28) is very nice and caring, and he works out. He is tall and has a lot of hair. Please notice me. The driver of that white car at Old Dufie; I like his composure. He is funny and cheers me up. His personality and biceps. My crush is very sweet and affectionate; he doesn't even realize it. When I am having a bad day, he appears and makes it better. He reserves his smiles for me. I think I am in love. I am attracted to girls with glasses. He smells divine. His brain, voice, way of talking, dressing, and walking. My crush has perfect hair, skin, build, voice, and face, and he is intelligent. He should like me back. She thinks everything I do is cute.  He has unique cornrows. My crush is intelligent and handsome. Mpenzi, you are HER. She is unapologetically herself. He is tall and plays basketball. It is incredibly sweet. He has a girlfriend, but he speaks to me as if I am his wife. One thing I love about him is that he is so naive it makes me feel very intelligent. He is not unintelligent; he actually helps me academically.  He is a man of God. He is tall.  I love the way he speaks French. I love her smile, her laughter. I love her body, even though she seems to dislike it. I love her eyes; I love the way they captivate me every time I look at them. I love the fact that she likes cold food, as unusual as that is. I just love her. Whoever is posting the outfits of the week should be questioned. He gave me dark chocolate with sea salt. Someone should tell her to please end the no-contact period. I was dating two men at the same time. So, the one I loved did not give me anything, but the one who loved me gave me a money bouquet and a human-sized teddy bear. To summarize, I posted the gifts from the man who loved me and ended up losing the one I loved. He did not make his move before Valentine's Day, so I bought a cake for myself on Valentine's Day in the name of self-love, and this man came to eat the cake with me. Very shameless! My foolish self could not say a word.  Never been celebrated on a Valentine's Day. But if the man I have been sending signals to notices them (although they are very weak), I will definitely write a successful love story.  It is just a normal day for some of us. We have no love stories yet."

If the ASC week is not enjoyable this year, we will protest. This is the first ASC Week, let us see if it meets expectations. If you are not interested in a relationship, why did you start talking to me in the first place? The mid-semester break should be extended by another week. It is frustrating having conversations with shallow-minded people who refuse to think critically. Friends with benefits is not bad. Graphic designers are amazing!

So much bitterness indeed.  A random list of people I want to be:
1. Isabel
2. Eunice
3. Her boyfriend (yes, I cannot decide if I want to be her or be with her). And I will never beg anyone.
Even if I were a dog, I would never beg you.
We are all watching as the new Athletic and Fitness Association allows the girls' football league to collapse? It would be better if I could get together with my crush. He is in my Women's Organisation Committee and Fundamentals of Development Economics class. One week we are watching movies in class, and the next, it's pop quizzes, three assignments, and two presentations.  Choose one!  Fundamentals of Development Economics, hmm. The girls do not support any of the women's leagues on campus but expect them to thrive. Even the participants do not want to do it again, but yes, it is the Athletic and Fitness Association's fault."
Week 74,"who has a solution to limerence???  I found him 🫢… (Partey Hi🌚) Can't you see I want you🙄? Is this how your friends treat you? Stop playing and call me, I'm on my knees😭 no but what if the ink isn't really anonymous Let's put ABA and AFA aside, girls participation to come see their own girls play is very low but at the end of the day it's the Associations fault. Wow🤲🏾 It’s a man’s world, nigga. I mean if people aren't passionate about it then it can't really survive. Nothing much else to say. what do you mean the people who don’t participate don’t want to do it again ?? this is the case every sem,  that’s how girls are ,but every AFA i’ve seen since i came to this school will always do something about it , reducing the pitch size , new goal posts, reshuffling, etc.. but this AFA have just kept quiet and they are watching the hard work of other year groups go to waste. What are leaders for ?? When something is going wrong do you sit there and watch or you do something  Most of the girls don’t want to participate in the sports here in Ashesi, they don’t even support their own and then they proceed to blame the AFA ah? How can a girl’s team have a match and they don’t have the starting 11??? if you are serious will you do that?? masa they shouldn’t blame anyone, they should encourage themselves to engage in sports that’s all.  Honestly personally I don’t care about sports weather male or female, so I was never going to show up for any event but if I were to show up I won’t show up when I know the game will last 3 minutes 😍 Women’s Football should just be separated from the AFA, we the ladies will just handle our business, period !!! I am scared that girls won't take sport seriously after C'25 and C'26 leave  Honestly, I believe that the Kasanom team should be dismantled and the players shared amongst other sides. 
Other teams are scared to play against them because of their dominance and this makes the league one way. And so that hinders participation as well  Honestly, there's not enough support. It's like in the shadows. We say oh inclusivity but then we're not pulling our weight. Like bro. I want to learn how to play basketball right? But then, the motivation isn't there bc I'm seeing the state of the women's basketball here and I wouldn't want to put myself in that position at all. Hats off to the ladies in all the sports teams out here. There is women sport in Ashesi?💀 I have a lot to say… but to the person saying Kasanomaa should be dismantled, do you think this is primary PE where your PE teacher forms teams for you to play just for fun??? Please be for realll😤😤. Players have the freedom to join the teams they want and coaches too try hard to contract the players they want on their teams. This is real life. Wake up from your dream bubble. The person saying they should dismantle kasanoma doesn't understand football. If a team is good, the team is good, point blank period. A great team shouldn't have to be dismantled just because other teams can't match up to that standard. A better way to put it is to loan players, that makes much more sense that let a team suffer at the expense of others what kind of silliness is that I feel like this AFA hmm. When it comes to girls football they forget the art of communication.  Personally, I don't think the AFA should be blamed. Its easier to blame those in charge than for the actual participants to take accoutaility. When most of the girls' team are as disciplined as the boys' or at least look interested and the AFA isn't doing anything then I think we can blame them then The current ASC lacks innovation. This whole destruction started from the top. How do you make promises to build women’s sports and end up choosing only men for the sports com position. You figure say words be action💀lmaoo Dear 28s...
Can you please be a little considerate when you're having you little meet and greets at night. You can't be making unnecessary noise at 1am while some of us are trying to sleep or study.
We understand that you guys like to catch up and all but PLEASE at 1am???😭😭 Players, coaches and the authorities need to understand that football is a competition. A team was trained enough to compete, same way the others should. You can't punish a team for living their dream. It should only take it's builders to break it down, not some AFA.  Can we end this discussion on the boy's and girl's football like most of us don't really care especially the girls stop blaming the AFA people I've seen firsthand what they do and it's a lot soooooooo if the boys and succeeding and the girls aren't but the AFA is doing the same thing they did last year I meannn ate they to blame and those saying the AFA should put in more effort to make the girls interested and come for practice like huh???? If they don't want it do you really think the AFA can do something?  Tsw this isn't Disney please we can't sing kumbaya and we'll all be happy  This AFA thing has blown o, you people should wait let me get my popcorn first This AFA thing has blown o, you people should wait let me get my popcorn first Excuse me AFA!! Are you okay?
Do you know the amount of time some people have invested in these women's football teams e.g Kasanoma. STOP THIS NONSENSE!! 
Some people are really passionate about this and you just come here and start saying absolute nonsense. All the trainings, all the matches won, all the injuries, all the comebacks, Chaleey! We are not playing games here.

This happens every semester; that is how some girls are.

Week 75,"Big shout out to the class of 28. They made opening night wonderful  The current ASC is the best. Kudos to them🎉 Didn’t come, but the snaps and stories have given me vim to come through on Friday. Well done to the entertainment committee  Every single DJ did their big one🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ Chaaleeee, e left small I would be late to class o but it was goooddd I loved the vibesss omgg. But please tell the steeze and aura farmers to go and sit down😭 bc why are you here if you won't danceee Last night was honestly so so fun. The energy was there and people were giving what they were suppose to giveeee. Cheers to No Bad Days🥂🥂🥂(I have quizzes on Wednesday and Thursday😪😪) Don Nortey’s set was so good!! It started off slow and I think they told him to speed it up and that’s what got the party started Well done entercom .It was fun. blaaaaasssstttt????? Can we have inclusive music on Friday We need to start a discourse on DJ Fadda….. The 28s are the best thing that happened to the Ashesi party life!!! Opening night ate so badddd It was good, maybe do the food tasting for longer next time, or start earlier so everyone is included. The Zimbabwe food was sooo goodd. I’m not even kidding  W day! I missed the cultural dance display cause of the rain but other than that, it was a fun day Saw the Mauritanian girl and a guy from cooking around 2am heerh tchaley the food was so nice. I don’t remember the name of the dish but they did really well.  Ivory Coast was one of the best 
The food, the outfit, the culture, the country itself is a vibe 
Congrats Ivorians 🇨🇮 It was fun, agreed. But what is going on in hostel 2C? Why do we have to fetch water now? Why do you provide us with water during class when we don't need it, but then there's none when we do? With all the money we're paying, why don't we have access to water? A critique from someone who doesn't want to be known for “that one time she went wild during ASC Week.”

 Everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess Yess, black Saturday 😭. Like why is a rubber mask 150 cedis? But seriously though, I think it's precisely because of people like this that school spirit dies. Are you the only one with ambitions and a reputation to keep? We all come together to let loose for one day in keeping with school culture, yet you make zero effort and then complain when you are judged.

If people sneer, it’s not personal. It’s out of frustration at your attitude. Reputation matters, but on crazy day, no one cares, bruh. If you’re that worried, get a full-body costume or something and don't kill the vibe. School is boring enough already Jenny is fr spitting. But also don't take it to heart. If you have confidence in your decision don't focus on this perceived judgement, but rather learn why they really think that beyond surface level reasons you may assume. Still 100%, live confidently in your decisions and don't make people's validations about you a priority at all. My problem is with the “reputation part” It makes it seem like the rest of the community is incompetent. ASC week is for both the student body and the faculty, it’s a period that brings the community together and shows school spirit. A chance for people like yourself who are “uptight “ as you say, to let loose and have alittle fun because life can get so serious that sometimes we forget to do that. Team spirit It’s actually an important value to have in the corporate world cause you honestly never know where you’d end up. 
Sure no problem, we respect your decision to not partake in any ASC WEEK activity or at least try to show some enthusiasm about it but don’t make it seem like the rest of the community is uncivilized and immature, talking about “I care about my reputation” and making it seem like the rest of us have none. Quite frankly it’s downgrading and belittling.  Jenny’s pseudo-intellectual essay (spark notes next time pookie) just highlights the condescension people who claim to not participate because it’s ‘just not their vibe ’ always carry with them. You can’t expect people to hold space for you when in the same breath you’re disrespecting their choices. A lot of people never participate but are good sports about it. If you care about your reputation that much, that’s great. It’s not our duty to cater to your lack of enthusiasm for school related activities (school approved I must add). And a lot of the points made weren’t well thought out, you may have just wanted to rant and that’s okay too. Hope you had a better time this year than the last, but allow people to have fun without subtly positioning yourself as morally and intellectually superior.  Such a dramatic think piece, and for what?  Dear 28s, never stop bringing the party energy even when the school starts lashing you. We need you activeeee 🔥 I agree with the revenge of lecturers part. Petition to create a law that allows students to actually have their way for the one week a year we’re supposed to pretend like school isn’t killing us slowly? I honestly think Jenny is the biggest hypocrite because why are you saying people are criticising you for not taking part in ASC week but at the same time making nasty comments about those who do participate?(Do you even know you insulted lecturers with your Crazy Day insult?) Let's hope your next critique has some growth in it. If you won't participate at least don't act like the people you dislike😇 See me my only issue is that if there's a party and you're coming to stand around, I beg, just don't come. You really kill the vibe because others are dancing and enjoying themselves and you look to your left and someone's child is just looking at you with a blank stare. Stay in your room if parties are not your vibe and allow the party animals to do their thing. If not, when you come, come with the intention of vibing a bit whether you know how to dance or not, you'll realise how much you'll enjoy yourself.  The person who typed their confession is just bitter chale. Talking about playing “inclusive songs” ei masa should we play Fela Kuti or something? Is it only ghanaian songs that are played at those events .If you don’t want to join ASC week fun because you feel like it’s not nice for you omo just exclusive yourself o it is not by force masa. There are other students (also international) that enjoy the ASC week more than some of the locals (as jenny will say it). i’m very disappointed with what whoever it is wrote chale. Trying to make niggas feel bad just because she doesn’t feel right about it.  Very valid. I side with the person wholeheartedly. I’m not going to look at you weird for cross dressing or whatever because it’s crazy day. There is no need to call me ‘Jon’ or whatever other silly term you can come up with if I don’t want to take part in the tomfoolery. Some people just don’t like noise and chaos. Imagine a lecturer drives from the other side of the town to come and have just one class, and you just ruin it because it’s crazy day and you feel like doing what you know you shouldn’t ideally do. How? How? for someone upset at being sneered at, she surely sneered at those of us who party… i also care about my reputation oh, sis, i’m not the circus clown you think i am Let’s be real 🤣, Partey’s bodycon was insane😅😅… man wey get small waist 😩 pass me  Ong no one cares that you decided to be the odd one upright person who has reputation . But don't come complaining that there's no community or it's not nice if you even refuse to partake. Staff members , faculty and even the dean and Patrick partake in crazy day but you undergraduate is the one with the reputation at stake? Okay. This constantly complaining about inclusivity matter is so ridiculous to me ( the ink I beg please post this). Inclusivity means we are adding you, inviting you to share in what we have, learn from what we have to offer and experience the culture with us. Being an international student to me is more like doing 8 study abroad semesters instead of one. You should be looking to learn and partake in the Ghanaian culture so when you go back home you have an expanded view of life. Whether you like it or not, Ashesi is a Ghanaian based school that you chose to attend  , that has made more than enough effort to make us all feel like we belong , and not in the sense of "" oh I belong because I'm familiar with it"" , but in the sense of "" I belong because this is something new that has been shared to me to partake in , I am welcomed in like an owner not a guest ( ei this is getting long o but bear with me). Realistically speaking, if we went to the party and every country had their music being played one after the other, the vibe will be very strange . (My opinion). So maybe we can take it up with ODIP to organize home away from home parties for y'all, but what we have here is access to Ghanaian artists and Ghanaian djs. Our asc dues are unfortunately not enough to fly in artists from Kenya and djs from South Africa. But what we have, we share with you and invite you to partake in it. Come to the party, dance with us and give a try to see if you can develop a love for what we have to share with you. Realistically, you are not home. But in our own way, we still want to make you feel welcome as though you were. So share in that with us, and let's stop complaining and begin to appreciate the new culture we've been exposed to and the new perspective we have been gifted with. We all listen to white people music without qualms , why draw the line at Ghanaian music? If you don't have access to the music you want, come teach your dance partner the dances from your country so you both can dance the foreign dance on Ghanaian music. Create the inclusivity you desire with what is available to you. It won't be handed on a platter ( PS : the ink I've put much time into typing this let it show to be posted I beg) Crazy day isn't only just about wearing cartons and trash cans on your head . It's about inclusivity and community.   It's the one day everyone looks relatively on the same level, and lecturers and staff lose the scary aura attached to them by virtue of their positions , and you get to freely relate to your dean of school affairs on a personal level. It builds the community , builds friendships and makes it easier moving on for you to approach people and school authorities about matters relating to school work because "" this is the same person that wore a carton on their head on crazy day and said "" oh darling Jesus"" with me.""
And so If you choose to segregate yourself from that community by being "" the odd 'responsible' one out"" , you should be ready to deal with the consequences ( the side eye looks) , because every choice has a consequence. No one is asking you to rip your clothes and walk tattered , dirty and semi-naked if you don't want to. What you only need to do is show a desire to be part of the community. We are secluded from the rest of the world( in a way) on this hill, and if you don't bond with us, who will you bond with? A little effort goes a long way. Have a presentation? Pack your "" crazy outfit in your bag and change after class with the 15 mins interval. Nurse Outfit too risky for   Your reputation? Layer it with a cloak, inner top and cargo pants. Scared to do something? Wear a mask. You can do what you want, no one will question you. For many shy introverts, crazy day is the one day they have a reason to go to the admin block and interact with staff, or talk to that one crush they've been thinking about without their anxiety threatening to swallow them alive. It's a beautiful day that everyone is happy and reminds us that we are not slaves to the grind and we deserve the right to be carefree and happy too. So let's all learn to appreciate it because I really love crazy day. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. ( please post this the ink. I really took my time to think and type 😭) So Maame Mensa Bonsu, Patrick Awuah , Coach Evonne and all the other lecturers who command so much respect, will respect for them reduce just because they participated in an ASC events? Are you implying events are degrading and rip one of their self dignity? If one of your friends tried to get you to participate forcefully, that is between you and them but please do not brand the participants of the ASC week as people who do not care about their ‘reputation’ just because you so hold on to something fragile. If the prices last year were too high for you perhaps you should veer away from branded clothing and new clothing and stick to foose and bargain. A lot of people did not pay full price for what they bought. And yes, they were sales but perhaps you were too blinded by your own delusion of things just being wrong and not up to your “standard”. And the comment on culture just defeats your whole argument on opening night, do expect. Who said you have wore short skirts to go for opening night? Didn’t you see people in bonnets, hoodies and even sweats? And you realize that the other 50% non-Ghanaian population is also very diverse in its sense right? Do you expect the ASC to fly every single non-Ghanaian artist on a very restricted budget to come and perform just because of “inclusivity”? What about pop culture day isn’t inclusive? What about Family Feud isn’t inclusive? Writing a whole article just to reflect and project your own personal insecurities is crazy in itself, and it’s what actually makes you lack a reputation. On that note I will be submitting my own take soon “Confession of a free-spirited student”  Kudos to ASC for the lovely week. But tell me why we have 2 global Cafes? One for Ghanaians and one for internationals? Why then do we have Ghana taking part in the international Global Cafe? Yes they can come and celebrate other countries’ cultures but for them to display twice (on both global Cafés ) is not fair. We want them to come observe and appreciate the same way wr observed and appreciate their own . Is that too much to ask for? Or we are in Ghana so everything should be Ghana? Well Miss Jenny isn't wrong with some things she said but I'd disagree with somethings too. The Black Market thing is a total rip off but as you said your wallet went unscathed so it's a choice. Yeah you're right that 50% of the population consist of international students but then again there's so much ASC can do with their budget. Especially when it has to with  inviting artiste. We'll expect more from me cause I'm still reading her 13 slides
Adios 
But yh she's also not wrong on how the ink selects what to post.
Pen name: Abɔdam EL in 2025 is crazy  ASC really for wise up. wtf??? El!?? Why would you bring us EL???
Someway pahnn I think it's high time we international students try to undersatnd that this is Ghana. Complaining about not playing your country music is unfair. Imagine they play a Shona song, it is only Shona People who will understand that it's not a Ghanian song. So let's just get used and eat what is served. Atleast I heard my country music and we are two people from my country. Some international students talk too much 💔, what again should Ashesi do for you guys? Should they bring your respective countries to Ghana for you to stay in it then😒? Life is never this deep if you don’t want to participate fine but don’t think you can stand on some high horse and shit on others. The S in ASC means STUDENT so all the many people who make these “forgettable” events possible are just like you stressed , overworked and unique. If you can do better I beg you to try Tsw. I have one question: Who went to attack Jenny like this? ☠️ I genuinely want to know who cared enough to tell Jenny to participate. We genuinely don’t care. Jenny, for someone who doesn’t like ASC week you seem to be very fixated on it. Even more than the ‘party people’. “If I don’t remember it, then it’s a problem”. 1400+ people in the school, grab a seat jenny Somebody ein last asc week then you go go bring Kaesa lmfao Jenny, chill. Jenny, what’s really wrong? We are here for you. It’s ASC week, not Jenny week. We don’t care. “I really don’t want to participate and everyone who judges me for that is crazy”
“They should play my music taste the whole time so I can participate”
“Cultural day is… cultural”
- A clown. Yes so hmm, first of all, what did Frida write? I’m so late to everything loooool Stuck up definitely I fooled so hard on crazy day so Jenny says I'm aimless & Tullow won't get me a job in the future yieeeee i'm shakinggg ooo but did you think 1nri would give you a shirt for 20 cedis?? bsfr + stick to your budget","A big thank you to the class of 2028.  They made opening night spectacular. The current Ashesi Student Council is the best; congratulations to them! I didn't attend, but the photos and stories have motivated me to come on Friday. Well done to the Entertainment Committee. Every DJ did an excellent job. Wow, I almost missed class, but it was incredibly good! I loved the atmosphere.  However, please tell those who only care about looking stylish to sit down; why are you there if you won't dance? Last night was truly fun. The energy was high, and everyone participated enthusiastically. Cheers to no bad days! (I have quizzes on Wednesday and Thursday.) Don Nortey's set was fantastic! It started slowly, but I think someone told him to speed it up, and that's when the party really began. Well done, Entertainment Committee. It was a blast! Can we have more inclusive music on Friday? We need to discuss DJ Fadda... The class of 2028 is the best thing to happen to Ashesi's social life!! Opening night was amazing.  It was good, but perhaps extend the food tasting next time, or start earlier so everyone can participate. The Zimbabwean food was delicious! I'm not even joking. What a day! I missed the cultural dance performance because of the rain, but otherwise, it was fun. I saw the Mauritanian student and a culinary student around 2 AM; the food was so good. I don't remember the dish's name, but it was excellent. Ivory Coast's representation was one of the best—the food, attire, culture, and country itself were amazing. Congratulations, Ivorians! It was fun, but what's happening in Hostel 2C? Why do we have to fetch water now? Why provide water during class when we don't need it, but not when we do?  Considering our tuition fees, why don't we have consistent water access?  A critique from someone who doesn't want to be known for ""that one time she went wild during ASC Week."" Everyone is entitled to their opinion, I suppose. Yes, Black Saturday. Why is a rubber mask 150 cedis? Seriously, I think this attitude is why school spirit dwindles. Are you the only one with ambitions and a reputation to protect? We all come together to relax for one day, yet you make no effort and then complain about judgment. If people sneer, it's not personal; it's frustration with your attitude. Reputation matters, but on a crazy day, no one cares. If you're worried, wear a full costume and don't spoil the fun. School is boring enough. Jenny is speaking the truth, but don't take it to heart. If you're confident in your decision, don't focus on perceived judgment but understand their opinions beyond surface-level assumptions. Live confidently in your decisions and don't prioritize others' validation. My issue is the ""reputation"" part; it makes the rest of the community seem incompetent. ASC Week is for students and faculty; it unites the community and showcases school spirit. It's a chance for those who are ""uptight,"" as you say, to relax and have fun because life can get serious. Team spirit is important in the corporate world. We respect your decision not to participate or show enthusiasm, but don't portray the rest of the community as uncivilized or immature by mentioning ""reputation"" and implying that the rest of us lack one. It's condescending and belittling. Jenny's essay highlights the condescension of those who claim non-participation is ""not their vibe."" You can't expect people to be understanding while disrespecting their choices. Many don't participate but are good sports. If you care about your reputation, that's great, but it's not our duty to cater to your lack of enthusiasm for school-approved activities. Many points were not well-thought-out; you may have just wanted to vent, and that's okay. I hope you had a better time this year, but let people have fun without subtly positioning yourself as superior. Such a dramatic piece, and for what? Dear 2028, keep bringing the party energy, even when the school tries to stop you. We need you! I agree about the lecturers' revenge. Let's petition for a law allowing students to have their way. That one week a year when we are supposed to pretend that school is not slowly killing us? I honestly think Jenny is the biggest hypocrite. Why are you saying people are criticizing you for not participating in ASC week, but at the same time making unkind comments about those who do participate? (Do you even realize you insulted lecturers with your Crazy Day insult?) Let us hope your next criticism shows some improvement. If you will not participate, at least do not act like the people you dislike. My only issue is this: if there is a party and you are coming to stand around, please, just do not come. You really kill the vibe because others are dancing and enjoying themselves, and you look to your left and someone's child is just looking at you with a blank stare. Stay in your room if parties are not your thing and allow the party animals to do their thing. If not, when you come, come with the intention of enjoying yourself a little, whether you know how to dance or not; you will realize how much you will enjoy yourself. The person who wrote that confession is just bitter, friend. Talking about playing ""inclusive songs""—should we play Fela Kuti or something? Are only Ghanaian songs played at those events? If you do not want to join in the ASC week fun because you feel it is not enjoyable for you, simply exclude yourself; it is not compulsory. There are other students (also international) who enjoy ASC week more than some of the locals (as Jenny would say it). I am very disappointed in whoever wrote that. Trying to make people feel bad just because she does not feel right about it. Very valid. I completely agree with the person. I am not going to look at you strangely for cross-dressing or whatever because it is Crazy Day. There is no need to call me ""Jon"" or whatever other silly name you can come up with if I do not want to participate in the foolishness. Some people simply do not like noise and chaos. Imagine a lecturer drives from the other side of town to come and have just one class, and you ruin it because it is Crazy Day and you feel like doing what you know you should ideally not do. How? How? For someone upset at being sneered at, she surely sneered at those of us who party… I also care about my reputation, sister; I am not the circus clown you think I am. Let us be real. Partey's bodycon was amazing. Man with a small waist—pass me. Honestly, no one cares that you decided to be the odd one out, the upright person with a reputation. But do not come complaining that there is no community or that it is not nice if you refuse to participate. Staff members, faculty, and even the dean and Patrick participate in Crazy Day, but you, an undergraduate, are the one with a reputation at stake? Okay. This constant complaining about inclusivity is so ridiculous to me (please, please post this). Inclusivity means we are adding you, inviting you to share in what we have, learn from what we have to offer, and experience the culture with us. Being an international student, to me, is more like doing eight study abroad semesters instead of one. You should be looking to learn and participate in Ghanaian culture so that when you go back home you have an expanded view of life. Whether you like it or not, Ashesi is a Ghanaian-based school that you chose to attend, and it has made more than enough effort to make us all feel like we belong, and not in the sense of ""oh, I belong because I am familiar with it,"" but in the sense of ""I belong because this is something new that has been shared with me to participate in; I am welcomed as an owner, not a guest"" (this is getting long, but bear with me). Realistically speaking, if we went to the party and every country had their music played one after the other, the vibe would be very strange (my opinion). So maybe we can take it up with ODIP to organize ""home away from home"" parties for you all, but what we have here is access to Ghanaian artists and Ghanaian DJs. Our ASC dues are unfortunately not enough to fly in artists from Kenya and DJs from South Africa. But what we have, we share with you and invite you to participate in it. Come to the party, dance with us, and give it a try to see if you can develop a love for what we have to share with you. Realistically, you are not home. But in our own way, we still want to make you feel welcome as though you were. So share in that with us, and let us stop complaining and begin to appreciate the new culture we have been exposed to and the new perspective we have been gifted with. We all listen to Western music without qualms; why draw the line at Ghanaian music? If you do not have access to the music you want, come teach your dance partner the dances from your country so you both can dance the foreign dance to Ghanaian music. Create the inclusivity you desire with what is available to you. It will not be handed to you on a platter (please, I have put much time into typing this; let it be posted, please). Crazy Day is not only about wearing cartons and trash. Crazy Day is a celebration of inclusivity and community.  It is a day when everyone feels relatively equal; lecturers and staff shed their usual authority, allowing for more personal interactions.  For example, you might casually chat with your Dean of School Affairs, having previously shared a silly moment with them during Crazy Day. This fosters community, builds friendships, and makes it easier to approach school authorities about academic matters later, because you've built a rapport.

However, choosing to remain aloof by being the ""responsible"" one carries consequences—you'll likely be noticed.  No one expects you to dress inappropriately; simply demonstrating a willingness to participate is enough.  We are somewhat isolated here on campus, and if you don't engage with the community, who will you connect with?  A little effort goes a long way.  If you have a presentation, pack your crazy outfit and change during a break.  Worried about your reputation with a nurse outfit? Layer it with a cloak, top, and pants.  Afraid? Wear a mask.  You are free to express yourself without judgment. For many shy students, Crazy Day is the only time they feel comfortable interacting with staff or approaching someone they have a crush on without overwhelming anxiety. It’s a day to be carefree and happy, reminding us that we deserve a break from the demands of academic life.  Let's appreciate it; I love Crazy Day.  Thank you for listening to my thoughts.

So, Maame Mensa Bonsu, Patrick Awuah, Coach Evonne, and other respected lecturers—does their participation in ASC events diminish their respect?  Are you implying these events are degrading? If a friend pressured you to participate, that's between you and them; don't label all participants as unconcerned about their reputation.  If last year's prices were too high, consider less expensive options instead of new, branded clothing. Many people didn't pay full price; there were sales.  Perhaps you were blinded by your own perceptions. Your comment about culture contradicts your opening night argument. Who says you must wear a short skirt to opening night? People wore bonnets, hoodies, and sweatpants.  The 50% non-Ghanaian student population is diverse.  Do you expect ASC, with a limited budget, to fly in every international artist for the sake of inclusivity?  Aren't Pop Culture Day and Family Feud also inclusive?  Writing an entire article to project your insecurities is ironic and damaging to your own reputation. I will soon share my perspective, “Confession of a Free-Spirited Student.”  Kudos to ASC for a wonderful week.

But why do we have two Global Cafés—one for Ghanaians and one for internationals? Why does Ghana participate in both? International students can celebrate other cultures, but having Ghana represented twice is unfair. We should observe and appreciate each other's cultures equally.  Is that too much to ask, or should everything be Ghana-centric because we are in Ghana? Jenny is partially correct, but I disagree on some points. The Black Market is exploitative, but your wallet remained untouched, making it a matter of personal choice.  Yes, 50% of the student body is international, but ASC has budget limitations, especially regarding artist invitations.  I’ll share more thoughts after I finish reading her 13 slides.

Goodbye.  She's right about the Ink's selectivity, however.

Pen name: Abɔdam EL in 2025 is crazy! ASC needs to improve.  Why EL?

I believe it’s high time international students understand that they are in Ghana. Complaining about the lack of your country's music is unfair. If they played a Shona song, only Shona people would understand it isn't Ghanaian. Oh, let us simply adapt and eat what is provided. At least I heard my country's music and we are two people from my home country. Some international students talk excessively; what else should Ashesi University do for you? Should they bring your respective countries to Ghana for you to reside in them? Life is not this complicated; if you do not want to participate, that is fine, but do not think you can act superior and criticize others. The ""S"" in Ashesi stands for Student, so all the many people who make these memorable events possible are just like you: stressed, overworked, and unique. If you can do better, I urge you to try. I have one question: Who attacked Jenny like that? I genuinely want to know who cared enough to tell Jenny to participate. We genuinely do not care. Jenny, for someone who dislikes Ashesi Week, you seem very preoccupied with it, even more than the partygoers. ""If I do not remember it, then it is a problem."" With over 1400 students in the school, take a seat, Jenny. Someone's last Ashesi Week, and you bring up Kaesa? Jenny, relax. Jenny, what is truly wrong? We are here for you. It is Ashesi Week, not Jenny Week. We do not care. ""I really do not want to participate, and everyone who judges me for that is crazy."" ""They should play my type of music the entire time so I can participate."" ""Cultural Day is...cultural."" —A clown. Yes, so, first of all, what did Frida write? I am so late to everything. Stuck-up, definitely. I was fooled so hard on Crazy Day, so Jenny says I am aimless and Tullow Oil will not get me a job in the future. I am trembling. But did you think 1nri would give you a shirt for twenty cedis?  That's utter nonsense; stick to your budget."

I admire your brilliance, a fun little app that grants today’s youth with the digital dopamine they desire. Structured like a slot machine, it keeps them scrolling as their minds subconsciously wonder  “Oh what next!” As they swipe through short form videos that have no correlation whatsoever. I really do admire you.       
You subconsciously shape the views and opinions of the youth without them knowing, pushing propaganda you wish to share subtly into their never ending assortment of videos.     You sell them products they  do not need by carefully boosting the view count  on the group of individuals on your side contributing to this crime, making sure to mix it in with contented designed specially for them based off of research and tracking. Ensuring the video ultimately shows up on their “For you” page. The only truthful thing about the app actually, a feed meticulously crafted with algorithms to maximize the time they spend interacting with you. You keep them performing a specific set of actions for hours on end. DOUBLE TAP, TAP Once at the mid right of the screen and scroll through and most importantly The CENTER SWIPE to reveal the next unpredictable video.

Week 77,"Great in many regards. I don't feel like I belong but that's not anyone's fault. Just circumstances. Otherwise everything is going well To the ink : Can y’all let “ Jenny “ rest? Like we get it. She voiced her opinion. Many didn’t agree. People responded, then you went on to do a video on it. Common. That was a stretch don’t you think? 

There was more on ASC week to talk about. Some questions you even asked us to fill but didn’t post. Your whole page has become a “Jenny” spin off. Abeg rest  Yvette(ASC president), If you ever lack a place to be in, you have two places reseverved, one in Heaven and another in my Heart. 
To cut the story short, the woman is so nice. DO NOT TELL THAT GIRL YOU LIKE HER Remove fde from the curriculum. It’s a threat to humanity. It really deteriorates our mental healths. Would have enjoyed the subject if it wasn’t for the many assignments and quizzes they give us . Back to back . To the lady that has a crush, I might know you. A hello will do. I don't bite😊 This semester has been great emotionally, spiritually and academically. I can now confidently say the abridged year is what actually messed up my gpa because tell me why I'm doing so great in a normal year hmm The hill speaks posts have slowed down to a trickle 😢 do yall need help? Girlll, which class is he in. The girlies can help you get to him and free tips too 😁 This is to the boys, one in particular: please, it's not by force to braid cornrows wai🙏. Some of you are rocking boneless braids confidently let me not lie. Ei so just like that we’re writing exams. I literally JUST ARRIVED😭😭. Ei so Ashesi every small thing nor, quiz, mid sem exam , presentation, final exam. Ei if I had known dier hm. This accelerated year dier someway oh.  Fuck exams, I want to go home💔😭 leaving campus at midnight cause you're studying is horrible 😭😭 this is the calmest I've ever been about exams A peaceful stay at home is the goal so pass dier we all go pass well.
Somebody shout POWER!!!!!! Honestly I can't wait to get this over with My exam prep strategy? 😒
Stare at my nonexistent notes, hope for osmosis.  Actually it's graduation I'm thinking about. Knowing numerous students I was cool with won't remember to call me in for a picture.  Depressed. Not just because of the exams,but life generally. If I ever do something nobody expects of me,I hope you all understand. This whole thing is overwhelming. I hope my family forgives me. ""Why not talk to someone? "" You ask? What difference would it make? They know it hurts,but they won't do anything about it even though they can (And if the day comes,if the hour comes, I'll drop it all here as I go). Doesn't always have to be light at the end of the tunnel, 'rest' could work too. At least you'll join the dots afterwards and it will all make sense.

Respectfully,
Me. Bro I’m tired of the shit people on this hill  Do yourself a favour and skip entrepreneurship for capstone. I’ve met some terrible people. Just do thesis okay, just you, your supervisor and God for your deadlines. No one to make you feel like shit, when all they do is tag along. Be wise  Taking your life is the weak thing to do. Deal with the shit In the end, the life you are living is yours and God’s. Once you realize that life in general is not that deep, such as school, family, work, etc., when anything happens, you won't be fazed because it’s one of those things. Look, there is always a period in life when you are in a dark place that feels like you can’t escape. But you will always come out of it. Put your trust in God alone and not man. Live for yourself self, not others, and find joy in yourself. There's more to life than what is around us. All the best 🌟  Sometimes you look to others to validate your pain, and when they don’t see it you think the world has come to an end.
But look within, the power you will you to end it all can be converted to the power you will use to change it all, to change your circumstances.
Look within and try and find ‘the Still Small Voice’ beckoning you to hold on and give God the chance to show you how good life can get.

I hope you hold on and fight for a better chance at life not for your family or anyone else, but for your future self. Life is hard but this is the test we are going through. Dear, just find someone you trust and talk to them. I love you although me nah know you.  Please eat something. So sorry you’re going through this.  My dear brother/sister, I know things feel heavy right now, but please remember that your life is a trust from Allah. No matter how deep the pain, committing something dangerous is not the way. Allah's mercy is greater than any hardship you're facing. Reach out, hold on, and know that this storm will pass. You are not alone. Allah is always with you. May Allah safeguard and protect you. Trust me I'd prefer you talk it out and get help that do something that will hurt us all and your loved ones. Pleaseeeee just don't try it🙏 it gets better i promise. life’s hard, very. but trust, a day would come and you’d be so proud of yourself. for what you’d ask. you kept swimming. Please don't do that to yourself. Trust me I've tried and it's not the funnest thing to do. The regret after it goes crazyyy. I don't want to be that guy but then think about the people who will be affected after you have just left from their lives. Ppl say that the world will continue moving even after you leave but then it won't be the same for your people, like the people you are close to/with. 

Think about fun things, sth that will take your mind off of it. Do fun things even if you want to sleep ah sleep o don't let you hurt yourself like that please I beg. I don't know who you are but I just want you to know that we've all got this and yeah. Shit now I'm sad. Please stay 😔🙏🏾 First off all, it’s completely understandable and normal to feel depressed. Try to look on the positive side of things. Sometimes even when it seems impossible. Count your blessings.Life will definitely continue throwing so many obstacles at us. But just know you are not alone. Take deep breathes. Start again from the top. We got this❤️
 And this second message in particular is for everyone else. Once in a while, hug your friends and tell them ‘everything will be okay, because we’ve already made it this far and overcome so many struggles, we can certainly pick up ourselves and do it again, together.’ You’ve got this. Even the darkest nights end with sunrise. “keep going.”❤️ Everything seems overwhelming: trying to figure out what you will do with your life after uni, thinking what would happen if things don't go as planned and not keeping the expectations our parents has about us — it's all stressful. However(ashesi effect lol), there is one thing we can always do, just to do our best and leave the rest to God. If we surrender all to Him and believe, everything will be fine. He is good all the time :) Can someone advise the Hakuna guy(Moses)? ","Things are going well in many respects. I feel like I don't belong, but that is not anyone's fault; it's just circumstance. Otherwise, everything is progressing smoothly.  Regarding Jenny: Can you all please leave Jenny alone? We understand she expressed her opinion, many disagreed, people responded, and then you made a video about it. That seems excessive. There were more important things to discuss during ASC week; you even asked us to answer some questions that you never posted. Your entire page has become a Jenny spin-off. Please, take a break. Yvette (ASC president), if you ever need a place to belong, you have two places reserved: one in Heaven and another in my heart.  To summarize, she is a very kind woman. Do not tell that girl you like her.  Remove FDE from the curriculum; it is a threat to humanity and significantly deteriorates our mental health. I would have enjoyed the subject if it were not for the constant back-to-back assignments and quizzes. To the person who has a crush on me: I might know you. A simple hello would suffice.

The girls can help you get to him and give you some free tips too. 😁  To the boys, especially one in particular: please, you don't have to braid cornrows.🙏 Some of you are confidently rocking boneless braids, I won't lie.  Wow, exams are just around the corner! I literally just arrived! 😭 Wow, Ashesi; every little thing is a quiz, mid-semester exam, presentation, or final exam. If I had known, hmm. This accelerated year is something else.  Screw exams; I want to go home.💔😭 Leaving campus at midnight because you're studying is terrible. 😭😭 This is the calmest I've ever been about exams.

Week 78,"sending love and prayers g, do take it upon yourself to see any of the counsellors, they're trained to be of some help to you🙏🏾 The first ever dream you had of your life is staring back at you with thoughtful eyes. Meditate on that scene and find peace with the fact that your imagination is your reality. That first dream.  It honestly doesn’t need to be all school and I say this as someone who does the work. Do the things that make you happy. If you need to watch a show, do that, if you need to be alone then do that. School will there whether you’re happy or not. Might as well make yourself happy to have a shot at doing the work. I’m not trying to reduce what you’re feeling but the environment here can be quite toxic and that’s not just the academics, if you know what I mean. Oh and when they say speak to someone, it doesn’t always have to be another person, could very much be God. I don’t know if you believe in Him or not, I still think He’ll listen and you may feel better about it. That’s my two cents but you always have a choice no matter what anyone says. Remember that  Hiii love! While giving up really is an option, I don't believe it is the best you can choose. Sometimes, just look back and consider how far you have come. You may not have found anything valuable along the way, but your journey in itself is value. You can create a gratitude journal where you write everything that ever goes well and makes you happy, and when you feel down, you go back and remember the good stuff. All the best!  Hey, it's me again. The person in the post. Things are only getting worse. I'm scared. Gotta start counting days. If anyone cares to help...we start from 50.  At least we'll have time to say silent goodbyes to the people who deserve that in the least. 

Not in my perfect shape,but I can still utter some wise words - If you ever find yourself in a situation that needs decision making and someone's life/future is concerned/involved,do it well. Do what you'd do if the person involved was of your lineage,or even you. 

That should help when you'll be joining the dots. Heyy,it will all be alright in the end. We are both grown. The rules don’t make sense to me. Engineering student and Business fi can’t date. Why will they change my business grades🤣🤣. some F-I dey want collect ma woman he figa he dey do am lowkey, just vim. honestly can’t support Ashesi’s decision to dismiss the FI over those relationships, because let’s be real ; emotions aren’t always something we can control. The deeper issue lies in the practice of bringing recent graduates back just a month after they leave to start teaching. These are people who still feel closely connected to the community, and sometimes those lines get blurry. Instead of creating healthier boundaries, it feels like we’re setting everyone up for trouble. Maybe it’s time to rethink the system, not just the individuals caught up in it. But love is blind🥹 But love is blind 🥹 I thought those were off limits since they're staff!!!!!!! Yohhhh this whole time I had a shot and I've been wasting it ....???? Time to get to work. It's just unfortunate cos these FI’s are hot ngl😌 As long as they're not your FI I don't see the problem because are you telling me that after being with my boyfriend from first year through to 3rd year, just because he's an FI now and I'm in final year (and still a student), we should break up? Eih!! Why the hel is this a question? 

It shouldn't happen I don’t see why they should be a problem unless, that particular FI teaches you, but then again an FI moving to you is the creepiest thing ever , you think they are being very  nice till “I love you “ 🤣🤣🤣 like lmaooooo??? that FI should be glad I didn’t report him whathehelly 🤣???  Ladies reduce the way you talk to males FIs. You're too attempting.
I am not saying there is any relationship though😂😂😂😂 If you're dating an FI as a student, please keep it HIDDEN, even if that FI isn't one for any of your classes. Best case, put it on hold till either one of you leaves the campus. You wouldn't want the situation where students find or take intimate images of you and the FI and twist the story as the FI taking advantage of you. It could be used to blackmail the FI. Worse, HR may find out and sack the FI.  It makes sense that we're asked not to date our FIs. It's not fair that people would study all night to get 60% and others would use bae to get 100. If you're in a relationship with someone and you become an FI, just don't be an FI for their course and it's fine.  Let’s forget FI matter first, please can’t these roommates know when to draw the line! It’s 12am and I need to sleep for my next class, why would you be disturbing everyone with your all night calls! This is so frustrating! Why don’t you just go and sleep on the car park so you can talk 1000hrs. So you’re dating so we shouldn’t sleep in peace??
 As an FI, if you say you can't resist because you were recently a student, shame on you. Grow up and manage your responsibilities. It's like saying you can't help but steal because the money is in front of you.  Student-FI relationships should be allowed!!! They are adults.Adults should be free to make their own choices. For a university that preaches inclusitivity and all,they should really be tolerant to this too.Not a big deal in my opinion. I have had sex with an FI. It was really good.  Munchies workers are so rude sometimes, mood swings all over, serving wrong food, not paying attention to details and being so nice to me but not to my neighbors. If you think you’re not in the mood to serve us, just pack your stuff and go home….. period!!! I’m sure there are are many ongoing but they just haven’t put a name on it. We see you getting too friendly. We see you🤭 Not related to the student -FI relationship but  the C’25 boys , they are the worst set ever .Especially those group of boys fuck them all ","Sending love and prayers, friend.  Please see one of the counselors; they are trained to help you.  The first dream you ever had is looking back at you thoughtfully. Meditate on that scene and find peace knowing your imagination shapes your reality. That first dream.  It does not have to be all about school, and I say this as someone who works in academia. Do things that make you happy. If you need to watch a show, do that; if you need to be alone, do that. School will be there whether you are happy or not. You might as well be happy to have a chance at doing the work. I am not trying to diminish your feelings, but the environment here can be quite toxic, and that includes more than just academics, if you know what I mean. Oh, and when people say “speak to someone,” it does not always have to be another person; it could very well be God. I do not know if you believe in Him, but I still think He will listen, and you might feel better. That is my opinion, but you always have a choice, no matter what anyone says. Remember that.  Hi, love! While giving up is an option, I do not believe it is the best one. Sometimes, just look back and consider how far you have come. You may not have found anything valuable along the way, but your journey itself is valuable. You can create a gratitude journal where you write everything that goes well and makes you happy, and when you feel down, you can go back and remember the good things. All the best!

Hey, it is me again, the person from the post. Things are only getting worse. I am scared. I have to start counting down the days. If anyone cares to help…we start from fifty. At least we will have time to say silent goodbyes to the people who deserve that, at the very least.

I am not in perfect shape, but I can still offer some advice: If you ever find yourself in a situation requiring a decision that involves someone's life or future, do it well. Do what you would do if the person involved were family, or even you.

That should help when you are connecting the dots. Hey, it will all be alright in the end. We are both adults. The rules do not make sense to me. An engineering student and a former instructor cannot date? Why would they change my business grades? Some former instructor is trying to get my girlfriend; he is doing it subtly, but aggressively. I honestly cannot support Ashesi's decision to dismiss the former instructor over these relationships because, let's be real, emotions are not always something we can control. The deeper issue lies in the practice of bringing recent graduates back just a month after they leave to start teaching. These are people who still feel closely connected to the community, and sometimes those lines get blurry. Instead of creating healthier boundaries, it feels like we are setting everyone up for trouble. Maybe it is time to rethink the system, not just the individuals caught up in it. But love is blind. But love is blind. I thought those relationships were off-limits since they are staff!  Yoh! This whole time I had a chance, and I have been wasting it… Time to get to work. It is just unfortunate because these former instructors are attractive. As long as they are not your former instructor, I do not see the problem. Are you telling me that after being with my boyfriend from first year to third year, just because he is a former instructor now and I am in my final year (and still a student), we should break up? Why is this even a question?

It should not happen. I do not see why they should be a problem unless that particular former instructor teaches you, but then again, a former instructor moving on to you is the creepiest thing ever. You think they are being very nice until ""I love you"" – lmao! That former instructor should be glad I did not report him! Ladies, tone down how you talk to male former instructors. You are too forward.

I am not saying there is any relationship, though. If you are dating a former instructor as a student, please keep it hidden, even if that former instructor is not teaching any of your classes. Best case, put it on hold until either of you leaves campus. You would not want a situation where students find or take intimate images of you and the former instructor and twist the story to make it look like the former instructor is taking advantage of you. It could be used to blackmail the former instructor. Worse, HR may find out and fire the former instructor. It makes sense that we are asked not to date our former instructors. It is not fair that people would study all night to get sixty percent, and others would use their significant other to get one hundred percent. If you are in a relationship with someone and you become a former instructor, just do not be a former instructor for their course, and it is fine.

Let's forget the former instructor issue for a moment. Please, can these roommates learn when to draw the line! It is 12 a.m., and I need to sleep for my next class. Why would you be disturbing everyone with your all-night calls? This is so frustrating! Why do you not just go and sleep in the car park so you can talk for a thousand hours? So you are dating, and we should not sleep in peace?

As a former instructor, if you say you cannot resist because you were recently a student, shame on you. Grow up and manage your responsibilities. Responsibilities. It is as if one cannot avoid stealing because the money is readily available. Student-faculty relationships should be permitted! They are adults. Adults should be free to make their own choices. For a university that advocates inclusivity, it should also be tolerant of this. It is not a significant issue in my opinion. I have had sexual relations with a faculty member. It was enjoyable.  Munchies workers are sometimes impolite, exhibiting unpredictable mood swings, serving incorrect food, failing to pay attention to detail, and being pleasant to me but not to my neighbors. If you are not in the mood to serve us, simply leave.  I am certain that many relationships are ongoing, but they are simply not publicly acknowledged. We observe your excessive friendliness. We see you.  Unrelated to the student-faculty relationship, the C'25 boys are the worst group ever. Especially that particular group of boys; I disdain them all."
